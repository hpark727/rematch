    "facts_of_the_case": "While serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in 2017, Donte Parrish sued the United States for $5 million, claiming prison officials unlawfully held him in administrative segregation for three years. After the district court dismissed his case in March 2020, Parrish did not receive notice of the dismissal until June 2020 due to his transfer to state custody. He promptly filed a notice of appeal, which the appeals court treated as a request to reopen his appeal time. The district court granted this request in January 2021, giving him 14 days to file a new appeal, but Parrish missed this deadline and instead sent a supplemental brief to the appeals court a few days late. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

      "eig_reasoning": "This action aims to retrieve the petition for a writ of certiorari, which is the foundational document for any case before the Supreme Court. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because the petition will provide the petitioner's detailed legal arguments, the precise framing of the legal question, citations to key precedents (like Bowles v. Russell or Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs.), and the asserted basis for SCOTUS jurisdiction (e.g., a circuit split). This moves my understanding from a brief, high-level summary to the core legal substance of the case, which is essential for making an informed prediction. Without this document, any analysis would be speculative.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because it reinforces a fundamental and universally applicable strategy for SCOTUS prediction: always begin by analyzing the petition for certiorari. Confirming the immense value of this step solidifies a core principle in the agent's information-gathering methodology. While not a novel strategy, its consistent high value is a crucial data point for refining the overall prediction process for all future cases.\n\nThe Joint EIG is therefore very high, as the action is critical for the immediate task and also provides strong validation for a core strategic design principle.",

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1. On April 7, 2017, Parrish drafted and signed a \nfederal complaint seeking compensation for the years \nhe wrongfully spent in administrative segregation and \ndelivered that complaint for mailing.  JA16\u201325, 132\u2013\n34.  The District Court received his complaint and \ndeemed it filed on May 3, 2017.  JA25. \nAfter multiple rounds of briefing, the District Court \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an opinion and order dated \nMarch 23, 2020 and a judgment dated March 24, 2020.  \nPet.App.55a, 57a, 59a.  Both documents were mailed \nto the federal prison in Illinois where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But \nunbeknownst to the court, Parrish was in the process \nof being transferred from federal to state custody.  Id.; \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address) (Apr. \n14, 2020).  As a result, Parrish did not receive notice \nof the judgment against him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat \nthe earliest,\u201d Pet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its \nentry and long after the time to file a notice of appeal \nhad expired, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted promptly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  Within 14 days of receiving \nnotice of the judgment, he filed a document entitled \n\u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; see D.Ct. Dkt. No. \n131-1 (notice of appeal envelope).  In that document, \nParrish explained the reason for his delay:  \u201cDue to my \nbeing transferred from Federal to State custody I did \nnot receive this order until June 25, 2020.  It is now \n7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of appeal.\u201d  \nPet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit construed that filing \nas a motion to reopen the appeal period under Rule \n\n13 \n \n4(a)(6) and remanded for the District Court to rule on \nthe motion.  Id. at 56a\u201358a. \nThe District Court found that Parrish had received \nnotice of the judgment more than 21 days after its \nentry, that he had moved for reopening within 14 days \nof receiving notice, and that no party would be \nprejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at 61a \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  It therefore reopened \nthe appeal period for 14 days.  Id. at 61a\u201362a.  It \nfurther directed the clerk to \u201csupplement th[e] Court\u2019s \nrecord accordingly, and transmit the same to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a. \n3. The case then returned to the Fourth Circuit.  \nThere, both Parrish and the Government agreed that \nParrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had become effective \nin light of the reopened appeal period.  See Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) at 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 \n(U.S. Br.) at 1. \nThe Fourth Circuit disagreed.  A divided panel \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, \nholding that he had \u201cnot file[d] a timely notice of \nappeal.\u201d  Pet.App.2a.  In so doing, the panel majority \nrecognized that the District Court had properly \nreopened the appeal period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6).  Id. at 4a\u20135a.  It reasoned, however, \nthat Parrish was required to file a new notice of appeal \nwithin the reopened appeal period\u2014i.e., 14 days from \nthe District Court\u2019s order.  Id. at 12a\u201313a.  And it \nrejected Parrish\u2019s argument \u201cthat when the district \ncourt reopened the time to appeal . . . , it \u2018validated\u2019 his \nprior untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 5a\u20136a.  \nAlthough the panel majority agreed that earlier-filed \n\n14 \n \nnotices of appeal can ripen when a district court grants \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension motion, the panel rejected \nthat principle for Rule 4(a)(6) reopening motions.  \nAccording to the panel, \u201creopening\u201d is different from \n\u201cextending.\u201d  Id. at 6a, 9a\u201312a.  Moreover, \u201cParrish\u2019s \nearlier filing ha[d] already been construed\u201d as a \nmotion to reopen and, in the majority\u2019s view, could not \nalso serve as a notice of appeal.  Id. at 3a\u20134a. \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He would \nhave held that Parrish\u2019s initial, pre-reopening notice \nof appeal sufficed to confer jurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s \nappeal.  Id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory pointed \nout that the Courts of Appeals consistently hold \u201cthat \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension retroactively validates an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And in \nJudge Gregory\u2019s view, the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted \ndistinction\u201d between reopening and extending an \nappeal period \u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. \nat 20a.  He also rejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s July 2020 filing cannot simultaneously \nserve as both a notice of appeal and a motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  In response, the Government agreed with \nParrish that the panel had erred in holding that it \nlacked jurisdiction.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, 12.  As \na result, the Government took \u201cno position with \nrespect to Parrish\u2019s request for panel rehearing.\u201d  Id. \nat 2.  But it opposed rehearing en banc on the ground \nthat, in its view, this issue was not \u201csufficiently \nimportant to warrant the intervention of the en banc \ncourt.\u201d  Id. \n\n15 \n \nThe panel denied rehearing over Judge Gregory\u2019s \ndissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the Fourth Circuit \ndenied rehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Id. at 63a\u2013\n64a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a statement in support of \nthe en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u201367a.  Judge Gregory, \njoined by three other judges, wrote a dissent.  Id. at \n67a\u201369a. \n\u201cAt its core,\u201d the dissenters explained, \u201cthis case \nrequires us to determine whether access to [appellate \ncourts] should be foreclosed for failure to refile a notice \nof appeal during the newly reopened period following \nsuccess under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a.  That issue, \nthe dissenters recognized, has \u201csplit\u201d \u201ccircuit courts \nand judges.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  And it is a question of \n\u201cexceptional \nimportance,\u201d \nincluding \nbecause \nit \ndisproportionately harms \u201cpopulations who may not \nbe \nable \nto \nconsistently \naccess \ninformation \nelectronically\u201d and has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects.\u201d  Id. at 68a\u201369a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThe Courts of Appeals are divided on the recurring \nquestion whether a notice of appeal filed before an \nappeal period is reopened becomes sufficient once a \ndistrict court reopens the appeal period, or whether a \nnew and duplicative notice of appeal is required after \nreopening.  This issue is profoundly important to the \npro se litigants it most frequently affects.  The decision \nbelow is wrong.  And this case is an excellent vehicle.  \nCertiorari should be granted. \nI. \nTHE COURTS OF APPEALS ARE DIVIDED. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit held that \na litigant must file a new notice of appeal after a \ndistrict court reopens the time to appeal under Rule \n\n16 \n \n4(a)(6).  Five Courts of Appeals disagree and hold that \na previously filed notice of appeal ripens once a Rule \n4(a)(6) motion is granted.  That split is entrenched:  \nThe Fourth Circuit has declined to reconsider its \nposition en banc, and three other circuits have \nacknowledged the split and adhered to their positions \nsince the panel\u2019s decision below. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Requires a New, Post-\nReopening Notice of Appeal. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit dismissed \nParrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did \nnot file a new notice of appeal after the District Court \nreopened the appeal period.  Pet.App.1a; see supra, at \n13\u201314.  In so doing, the court held that an order \ngranting a motion to reopen under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) does not \u201cvalidate [an] earlier filed \nuntimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.10a; see id. at 5a\u2013\n6a.  It further reasoned that a single filing cannot \nsimultaneously serve as a motion to reopen and a \nnotice of appeal.  See id. at 3a\u20134a.  Accordingly, \nlitigants in the Fourth Circuit who file a notice of \nappeal before a motion to reopen is granted must file \na second, duplicative notice within 14 days of the \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order to pursue an appeal.  \nId. at 12a\u201313a. \nAlthough the decision below recognized that a prior \nFourth Circuit panel had accepted jurisdiction based \non a pre-reopening notice of appeal, the court \ndefinitively rejected that position.  Id. at 12a \n(discussing Grant v. City of Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x 236 \n(4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam)).  \u201cThis unpublished \ndecision,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdoes not, in its one short \nparagraph, conduct any analysis of the Rule 4(a)(6) \n\n17 \n \nissue\u201d and \u201chardly constitutes binding, persuasive \nauthority.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the prior decision itself \ndisclaimed any precedential value.  Grant, 810 F. \nApp\u2019x at 236 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not binding \nprecedent in this circuit.\u201d). \nThe decision below thus reflects the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndefinitive answer to the Question Presented.  And the \nFourth Circuit declined to reconsider its position en \nbanc\u2014despite the parties\u2019 agreement that the panel \nhad erred, despite a dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc, and despite its recognition of the \ncircuit split.  See supra, at 14\u201315.  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nposition is thus deeply entrenched. \nB. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits Do Not Require a New, \nPost-Reopening Notice of Appeal.  \nThe Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth \nCircuits disagree with the Fourth Circuit and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants reopening under Rule 4(a)(6).  In \nthose jurisdictions, Parrish\u2019s appeal would have been \nheard on the merits. \n1. In Winters v. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. \n2023), the Sixth Circuit held that an appellant who \nfiles a notice of appeal prior to a reopening order does \nnot need to file a second, post-reopening notice of \nappeal.  The facts of that case are substantively \nindistinguishable from the facts of this one.  Like \nParrish, Winters was a pro se inmate who did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment because \nhe had been moved from one correctional facility to \nanother.  Id. at 667.  Like Parrish, Winters promptly \nfiled a notice of appeal that was treated as a motion to \n\n18 \n \nreopen.  See id. at 668.  And like Parrish, Winters did \nnot file a new notice of appeal within 14 days after the \norder reopening the appeal period.  See id. \nBut unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held \nthat \u201cWinters did not need to file a new notice of \nappeal after the district court granted the motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id at 671.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit \nrecognized that \u201cthe courts of appeal are not all in tune \non these issues.\u201d  Id. at 672 (citing, inter alia, the \ndecision below).  And it rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nanalysis at every turn.  A premature notice, the court \nreasoned, \u201cripens when the window to appeal \nbegins\u201d\u2014no matter whether the event triggering the \nappeal period is the entry of final judgment, Rule 54(b) \ncertification, or Rule 4(a)(6) reopening.  Id. at 671 \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2) (final judgment), and \nGood v. Ohio Edison Co., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. \n1997) (Rule 54(b) certification)).  And \u201ca single \npleading may serve more than one function\u2014for \nexample, . . . a notice of appeal may serve as a motion \nfor an extension of time.\u201d  Id. at 669\u201370 (citing Smith \nv. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 249 (1992)). \n2. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in \nUnited States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th \nCir. 2011).  Like Parrish and Winters, Withers\u2014\nanother pro se inmate\u2014filed an untimely notice of \nappeal.  See id.  And like Parrish and Winters, Withers \nexplained in his notice that he received the judgment \nonly after the initial appeal period had expired.  See \nid.  The Ninth Circuit held that the district court \nshould have construed Withers\u2019 notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted it.  Id.  It \nfurther held that the pre-reopening notice of appeal \nwas sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.  See id.  \n\n19 \n \n3. The Third, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have \nendorsed the same rule, albeit in unpublished \ndecisions. \na. In Holden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 \n(3d Cir. Dec. 20, 2023), the Third Circuit considered an \nappeal in the same mold as Parrish\u2019s, Winters\u2019, and \nWithers\u2019:  A pro se inmate received notice of a \njudgment \nafter \nthe \ntime \nto \nappeal \nexpired, \nimmediately filed a document captioned \u201cnotice of \nappeal,\u201d was granted reopening under Rule 4(a)(6), \nand did not file a new notice of appeal during the 14-\nday reopening period.  See id. at *1, n.4.  The Third \nCircuit recognized that the \u201cappeal [was] timely, and \n[that] [it] ha[d] jurisdiction,\u201d notwithstanding the \nabsence of a post-reopening notice of appeal.  Id. \nb. The Seventh Circuit has addressed this issue \nboth before and after the decision below.  First, in \nNorwood v. East Allen County Schools, 825 F. App\u2019x \n383 (7th Cir. 2020), the appellant\u2014a school teacher \nacting pro se\u2014filed a notice titled \u201cBelated Appeal\u201d \nthat explained he had not received timely notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 386.  The district court \nconstrued the notice as a motion to reopen and granted \nit, finding no evidence that the teacher had been \nserved with the judgment.  See Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., No. 15-cv-249, Dkt. No. 196, at 3 (N.D. \nInd. Feb. 26, 2019).  The teacher did not file a new \nnotice of appeal during the 14-day reopening period.  \n825 F. App\u2019x at 386.  But the Seventh Circuit held that \nthe teacher\u2019s initial notice had become effective when \nthe appeal period was reopened.  Id.  \u201cThat [he] filed it \nbefore the judge reopened the window to appeal\u201d did \nnot \u201caffect its timeliness,\u201d the court reasoned, because \n\u201ca prematurely filed notice of appeal becomes effective \n\n20 \n \nafter the district court enters the order that opens the \ntime to appeal.\u201d  Id. at 387. \nIn Hammer v. Bortz, 2024 WL 2559204 (7th Cir. \nMay 24, 2024), the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the \ncircuit split created by the decision below but adhered \nto its position.  See id. at *3.  The appellant\u2014a pro se \ninmate\u2014learned of the judgment against him only \nafter inquiring about the status of his case.  Id. at *2.  \nAnd he filed a notice of appeal accompanied by a \ndeclaration explaining that he had only just received \nuntimely notice of the adverse judgment.  See id.  The \nSeventh Circuit construed that filing as a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion, and the district court granted it.  Id.  Although \n\u201cHammer did not file a new notice of appeal\u201d during \nthe 14-day reopening period, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat his initial notice \u201cbecame effective\u201d \u201cwhen the \njudge accepted [his] explanation and granted the \nmotion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at *3. \nIn so holding, the Seventh Circuit observed that \n\u201c[o]ther circuits that have addressed this question \nhave reached divergent conclusions on whether the \nfailure to file a new notice of appeal after the time is \nreopened deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction.\u201d  \nId. (citing the decision below and Winters, 88 F.4th at \n671).  Recognizing that its prior \u201cpractice ha[d] aligned \nwith the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\u201d\u2014not the Fourth\u2019s\u2014the court \nagain held that \u201ca second notice of appeal within the \nreopened window for appeal\u201d is not required.  Id. \nc. The Tenth Circuit reached the same result in both \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998), and Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022).  In \nMarshall, a pro se inmate filed a late notice of appeal \n\n21 \n \nafter notice of a judgment against him was mailed to \nthe wrong prison.  See 1998 WL 864012, at *2.  The \ndistrict court then granted his motion to reopen the \nappeal period.  See id.  Relying on circuit precedent \naddressing Rule 4(a)(5) motions, the Tenth Circuit \nheld that \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of a Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(6) motion validates a notice of appeal filed prior \nto the entry of such an order.\u201d  Id. (footnote omitted)).  \nIn the Rule 4(a)(6) context, just as in the Rule 4(a)(5) \ncontext, \u201cto require the filing of a new notice of appeal \nwould amount to little more than empty paper \nshuffling.\u201d  Id. (quoting Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 \nF.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nSimilarly, in Farrow, the appellant\u2014yet another \npro se inmate\u2014filed a notice of appeal at the same \ntime as a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen, asking the \ncourt \u201cto process the notice once it had addressed his \nmotion.\u201d  2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1.  He never filed a \nsecond notice after the motion to reopen was granted.  \nBut the Tenth Circuit held that the previously filed \nnotice \nof \nappeal \n\u201cbecame \neffective, \nconferring \n[appellate] jurisdiction\u201d when the appeal period was \nreopened.  Id. \n* \n* \n* \nThe circuits are thus openly divided about whether \nthey have jurisdiction to hear appeals like Parrish\u2019s.  \nHad Parrish been incarcerated in the Third, Sixth, \nSeventh, Ninth, or Tenth Circuits, his appeal would \nhave been decided on its merits.  But because he was \nincarcerated in the Fourth Circuit, his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Courts on both sides \nof the split have acknowledged the division of \nauthority, and the Fourth Circuit has refused to \n\n22 \n \nreconsider its outlier position.  Only this Court can \nrestore uniformity. \nII. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT. \nThe division of authority on the Question Presented \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  This issue recurs even \nmore frequently than the decisions above suggest.  \nAnd when it does arise, it is outcome-determinative of \na litigant\u2019s right to appeal. \n1.a. Courts encounter cases like Parrish\u2019s all the \ntime.  In just one week in December 2023, for example, \nthe Third Circuit and the Sixth Circuit both issued \ndecisions holding that a duplicative notice of appeal is \nnot required.  See Winters, 88 F.4th 665 (6th Cir. Dec. \n15, 2023); Holden, 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. Dec. 20, \n2023).  The Fourth Circuit was considering Parrish\u2019s \nen banc petition during the same time.  And in June \n2024, the Fourth Circuit dismissed at least three \nappeals in the same posture as Parrish\u2019s.  See Sparks \nv. Russell, 2024 WL 2862119 (4th Cir. June 6, 2024); \nHammond v. Burns, 2024 WL 3102794 (4th Cir. June \n24, 2024) (consolidating and dismissing two appeals). \nThose cases, moreover, are just the tip of the \niceberg.  Although the Question Presented is \njurisdictional, its answer is often undisputed by the \nparties.  See, e.g., Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1 \n(agreeing that no second notice was required).  As a \nresult, courts frequently proceed to the merits without \ndiscussing the potential problem.  See, e.g., Dec v. \nPennsylvania, 2024 WL 3338301 (3d Cir. July 9, 2024); \nMcKenzie v. Wolfe, 2024 WL 399104 (4th Cir. Feb. 2, \n2024).  That means that the outcome of substantively \nidentical appeals can turn not only on the circuit in \nwhich each appeal is filed but also on the \n\n23 \n \nhappenstance of whether each panel happens to notice \nthe potential jurisdictional flaw.  It also means that \nthe Question Presented almost certainly arises in \nmany more cases than the opinions addressing it \nreflect. \nb. That should come as no surprise.  Last year, pro \nse litigants filed nearly half of all notices of appeal.  \nSee 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 9 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2023), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/\n2023year-endreport.pdf.  And close to 90% of prisoner \nappeals were filed pro se.  Id. \nPro se litigants are exponentially more likely to \nreceive untimely notice of a judgment than counseled \nparties.  Whereas attorneys receive immediate notice \nthrough electronic case-filing systems, pro se litigants \nreceive notice by snail mail.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n77(d)(1) (requiring clerk to notify parties of orders and \njudgments as provided by Rule 5(b), which provides for \nservice by mail upon pro se litigants).  Unlike \nelectronic notifications, mail often gets delayed in \ntransit.  See U.S. Postal Serv., Analysis of FY 2023 \nPerformance \n31 \n(2024), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2803_2\n804%20Report_Final.pdf (\u201cIn FY 2023, the Postal \nService failed to meet six out of its eight targets for\u201d \nfirst-class mail products, including late delivery of \nnearly 20 percent of mail meant to be delivered within \nthree to five days); U.S. Postal Serv. Office of Inspector \nGeneral, Spring 2024 Semiannual Report to Congress \n17 (2024), available at https://www.uspsoig.gov/\nsites/default/files/reports/2024-05/FY2024_Spring\n_SARC.pdf (reporting problems with timely mail \ndelivery in 95% of audited locations).  And unlike \n\n24 \n \nemail addresses, physical addresses do not follow \npeople around when they move\u2014which can cause \ndelivery failures and forwarding delays.  See, e.g., \nAcosta v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, 2021 WL \n5395997, \nat \n*3 \n(N.D. \nTex. \n2021) \n(discussing \ndocumentation of USPS mail forwarding delays of up \nto 10 days); Gallegos-Lopez v. Kansas City, 2009 WL \n2912637, at *2 (D. Kan. Sept. 9, 2009) (USPS failed to \ntimely forward EEOC\u2019s right-to-sue letter to new \naddress); Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., dissenting) (\u201cRule \n4(a)(6) is usually invoked under circumstances where \na party relocates, is relocated, or is otherwise unable \nto receive mail at the address listed with the court.\u201d). \nPro se prisoners face even more serious obstacles to \nobtaining timely notice\u2014and have less power to \nmitigate them.  See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, \n270\u201372 (1988) (pointing out pro se prisoners\u2019 lack of \ncontrol over outgoing mail); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49, Adv. \nComm. Notes (2018 Amendment) (recognizing that \n\u201cincarcerated individuals . . . often lack reliable access \nto the internet or email\u201d).  Prison mail systems are \nnotoriously slow.  See Advisory Comm. on Appellate \nRules, Agenda for Fall 2016 Meeting 163 (2016), \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2016-10-\nappellate-agenda-book_0.pdf \n(reporter\u2019s \nmemorandum identifying recurring legal questions \narising from \u201cdelay by prison authorities in delivering\u201d \ncourt orders to prisoners); Dallas Morning News, Mail \nDelays \nFrustrate \nPrisoners \n(Nov. \n12, \n2023) \n(documenting delays of three weeks to two months in \nTexas prisons\u2019 mail processing); Penton v. Johnson, \n2023 WL 7121407, at *2\u20133 (9th Cir. Oct. 30, 2023) \n(denying qualified immunity to prison officials who \nfailed to forward a transferred prisoner\u2019s mail \u201cfor over \n\n25 \n \nseven months\u201d).  And prisoners are often moved \nbetween facilities without notice.  See U.S. Marshals \nServs. Office of Pub. Affairs, Fact Sheet: Prisoner \nTransportation, \nhttps://www.usmarshals.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/media/document/2024-Prisoner-\nTransportation.pdf (reporting nearly a quarter million \nprisoner movements by the Marshals Service in FY \n2023, at an average pace of almost 1,000 prisoner \nmovements each day); Grandison v. Moore, 786 F.2d \n146, 149 (3d Cir. 1986) (\u201cPrisoners . . . have no control \nover their whereabouts, and may be temporarily \ntransferred out of the prison for court proceedings or \nplaced in administrative or punitive segregation which \ncan delay mail delivery.\u201d); see, e.g., Pet.App.60a\u201361a; \nWinters, 88 F.4th at 671.  Indeed, Mr. Parrish has been \nheld in three different institutions just this calendar \nyear. \nWith tens of thousands of pro se appeals filed each \nyear, even a low rate of mail-delivery delay or failure \nproduces a meaningful number of cases where a \nlitigant must rely on Rule 4(a)(6) for the chance to \nappeal. \nc. Pro se litigants who belatedly receive an adverse \njudgment often attempt to salvage an appeal in one of \ntwo ways.  Many litigants file a notice of appeal that \ncontains an explanation for their delay.  See, e.g., \nPet.App.71a; Winters, 88 F.4th at 668; Withers, 638 \nF.3d at 1061.  Courts must construe pro se filings \ngenerously, see Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 \n(2007) (per curiam), so such notices are construed as \nRule 4(a)(6) motions.  See Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062.  \nOther litigants file a notice of appeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion simultaneously.  See, e.g., Farrow, 2022 WL \n274489, at *1 n.1.  The upshot in either case is the \n\n26 \n \nsame:  Litigants who try to appeal and explain the \ncircumstances as soon as they learn of the judgment \nagainst them may receive relief in the form of a \nreopened appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6). \nBut some pro se litigants will have no meaningful \nopportunity to file a second notice of appeal within the \n14-day reopening window.  Every litigant who benefits \nfrom Rule 4(a)(6), by definition, previously failed to \nreceive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A).  And if \nsuch a litigant does not receive notice of the reopening \norder before the 14-day window closes, he cannot \npossibly file a second notice of appeal on time. \nEven when litigants do promptly learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened, it may not even \noccur to them that a second notice of appeal might be \nrequired.  The Rules Advisory Committee has long \nrecognized that \u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se \nlitigants, fail to file [a] second notice of appeal.\u201d  Adv. \nComm. Notes (1993 Amendment).  And who could \nblame them, given that courts often affirmatively \ninform litigants that they need not file a duplicative \nnotice.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Lamanna, 2021 WL \n1759924, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2021) (\u201cPlaintiff need \nnot file a new notice of appeal.\u201d); Jacoby v. Thomas, \n2019 WL 3226896, at *3 (M.D. Ala. July 17, 2019) \n(\u201c[Plaintiff] is not required to file a new notice of \nappeal.\u201d); Brown v. United States, 2010 WL 376922, at \n*1 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2010) (previously filed notice of \nappeal \u201cshall be deemed timely filed\u201d upon reopening \nof appeal period).  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit initially \nsuggested as much in this very case.  See Pet.App.58a \n(\u201cThe record, as supplemented, will be returned to this \ncourt for further consideration.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \n2. In addition to recurring frequently, the Question \nPresented also has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those it \naffects.\u201d  Pet.App.69a (Gregory, J., dissenting).  That \nis because a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional \nrequirement.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214.  This Court \nhas already held that an appeal must be dismissed if \na notice of appeal is filed after the 14-day reopening \nperiod has expired.  See id. at 207\u201309.  And neither 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107 nor the Federal Rules authorizes courts \nto extend or reopen the reopening window under any \ncircumstances.  See id. at 214 (\u201cCourt[s] ha[ve] no \nauthority to create equitable exceptions[.]\u201d). \nAs a result, litigants who do not learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened (or that a second \nnotice is required) until after the 14-day window has \nclosed are left with no possibility of recourse.  That is \ntrue no matter the strength of their appellate \narguments or how inequitable that result might be. \nThe harsh consequences of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule \nare particularly troubling given the population this \nissue \u201cmost commonly\u201d affects: \u201cpro se litigants who \nwere unable to notice their intent to seek [appellate] \nreview during the statutory appeals period, often due \nto no fault of their own.\u201d  Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., \ndissenting).  These litigants are disproportionately \n\u201celderly, \nunhoused, \ndetained, \nimprisoned, \n. . . \ndifferently abled,\u201d or otherwise unable \u201cto consistently \naccess information electronically.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s rule thus \u201crequire[s] more of those \nwho have less.\u201d  Id. at 69a. \n \n\n28 \n \nIII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S POSITION IS WRONG. \nAs the Government recognized below, see Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 84, at 2, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s minority rule is \nalso simply wrong.  Like other premature notices of \nappeal, notices of appeal filed before the appeal period \nis reopened become effective once a motion to reopen \nis granted.  The use of the word \u201creopen\u201d in Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) does not justify a different \nresult.  And there is no reason why a notice of appeal \ncannot serve two functions at once. \n1.a. Unlike filing a notice of appeal too late, filing a \nnotice of appeal too early does not \u201cextinguish an \notherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  \nThat principle\u2014sometimes called the doctrine of \n\u201ccumulative finality,\u201d see generally Bryan Lammon, \nCumulative Finality, 52 GA. L. REV. 767 (2018)\u2014\nfollows from this Court\u2019s functional approach to \nnotices of appeal.  See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. \n757, 767 (2001) (holding that a notice suffices so long \nas there is \u201cno genuine doubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, to which appellate court\u201d).  \nTaking that same functional approach, the Courts of \nAppeals have long held that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal becomes procedurally \nproper.  See, e.g., Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d \nCir. 1975) (notice filed after announcement of a \ndecision but before the entry of judgment); Firchau v. \nDiamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269, 271 (9th Cir. 1965) \n(notice filed after dismissal of a complaint but before \ndismissal of the entire action); Bryant v. Elliott, 467 \nF.2d 1109,1109 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (notice \nfiled after expiration of the appeal period but before \nextension was granted).  And this Court expressly \nendorsed the ripening principle in FirsTier.  See 498 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. at 274 (\u201cconclud[ing] that Rule 4(a)(2) permits a \nnotice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to \nserve as an effective notice from a subsequently \nentered final judgment\u201d). \nThe ripening principle is also reflected in the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  It appears in \nRule 4(a)(2), which provides that \u201c[a] notice of appeal \nfiled after the court announces a decision or order\u2014\nbut before the entry of the judgment or order\u2014is \ntreated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\u201d  It \nis reflected in Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(i), which provides that \u201ca \nnotice of appeal\u201d filed \u201cafter the court announces or \nenters a judgment\u2014but before it disposes of [certain] \nmotion[s] listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014 . . . becomes \neffective . . . when the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion is entered.\u201d  And it appears in an \nanalogous provision for criminal appeals, too.  See \nRule 4(b)(2).  These provisions were added to the \nFederal Rules in 1979 in \u201crecogni[tion]\u201d of the pre-\nexisting consensus among the Courts of Appeals that \n\u201cpremature appeals\u201d are \u201ceffective.\u201d  Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1979 Amendment). \nConsistent with that broader principle and this \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in FirsTier, the Courts of Appeals \nconsistently hold that prematurely filed notices of \nappeal ripen not only in the circumstances covered by \nRules 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(4)(B)(i), but also in contexts not \naddressed by those provisions.  Most notably, the \nCourts of Appeals uniformly recognize that a notice of \nappeal filed before a needed Rule 54(b) certification \nripens once that certification is obtained\u2014even though \nRule 4 does not expressly provide for ripening in that \nsituation.  See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, \n1184\u201385 (1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); Tilden Fin. \n\n30 \n \nCorp. v. Palo Tire Serv., Inc., 596 F.2d 604, 607 (3d Cir. \n1979); Good, 104 F.3d at 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n \nof Bds. of Pharm. v. Bd. of Regents, 633 F.3d 1297, \n1307 (11th Cir. 2011); State Contracting & Eng\u2019g Corp. \nv. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1334\u201335 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \nb. The same principle\u2014that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal period opens\u2014controls \nhere, too.  That result follows directly from this Court\u2019s \nholding in FirsTier.  And it is consistent with the way \npremature notices of appeal are treated in other \ncontexts.   \nIt is also consistent with the functional approach to \nnotices of appeal, because a second, post-reopening \nnotice of appeal serves no conceivable purpose.  Once \nthe initial notice is filed, there can be \u201cno genuine \ndoubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, from what judgment, \nto which appellate court\u201d in this context.  Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767.  If anything, a notice of appeal filed before \nRule 4(a)(6) reopening gives the appellee more notice \nof the coming appeal than one filed after reopening.  \nAnd an appellee will never be prejudiced when an \nappeal proceeds based on the premature notice, \nbecause Rule 4(a)(6) reopening is available only if the \ndistrict court finds that no prejudice will flow from \nreopening.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6)(C). \n \nAccordingly, \na \nsecond-notice \nrequirement would be a \u201chollow ritual\u201d that amounts \nto nothing more than \u201cpaper shuffling.\u201d  Hinton, 997 \nF.3d at 778 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd at what cost.  It would create a trap for unwary \npro se litigants.  See supra, at 23\u201327.  And even where \npro se litigants do manage to spot the tripwire, it \nwould still leave some litigants in the lurch through no \n\n31 \n \nfault of their own, because litigants eligible for relief \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) may not even learn of an order \ngranting a motion to reopen until after the 14-day \nreopening period expires.  After all, they necessarily \ndid not learn of a judgment within a longer 21-day \nperiod.  See supra, at 26. \n2. The Fourth Circuit did not even cite FirsTier.  \nAnd it offered no justification for deviating from the \nbackground presumption of cumulative finality.  \nInstead, it relied on an untenable distinction between \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) and \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).  According to the Fourth Circuit, \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) contemplates an \nunbroken period from the entry of the appealable \norder to the end of the extended appeal period.  \nPet.App.9a\u201312a.  That continuity, it reasoned, is what \nallows a premature notice of appeal to ripen when a \nRule 4(a)(5) extension motion is granted.  Id.  By \ncontrast, the Fourth Circuit insisted that \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) creates a new, noncontiguous \nappeal period.  Id. at 9a\u201310a.  As a result, it concluded \nthat a premature notice of appeal does not ripen when \na Rule 4(a)(6) motion is granted.  See id. \nBoth premises underlying that analysis are wrong.   \na. The first faulty premise is that an extension \nunder Rule 4(a)(5)\u2014unlike reopening under Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014necessarily involves an unbroken appeal \nperiod.  By the plain terms of \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(5), a motion for an extension can be filed up to 30 \ndays after the appeal period has lapsed.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).  Indeed, this Court \nrecently cited Rule 4(a)(5) extension motions as an \nexample of extensions that do not necessarily involve \n\n32 \n \na continuous period of time.  In HollyFrontier, the \nCourt held that refineries may receive a benefit in \nYear 1, not receive that benefit in Year 2, and then \nreceive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same benefit in Year 3.  \n594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, it relied on an \nanalogy to Rule (4)(a)(5) extensions.  \u201cUnder certain \ncircumstances,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca court \u2018may . . . \nextend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 even \u2018after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)).  \n\u201cIn other words, the timer can start, run, finish, and \nthen restart\u201d\u2014precisely \u201cbecause a court has the \npower to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after a lapse.\u201d  \nId. at 391. \nHollyFrontier \nthus \nexpressly \nrejected \nthe \nproposition that extensions always \u201cretroactively \ndeem[] the time originally allotted as now extending \ncontinuously to some new and future due date.\u201d  Id. at \n392.  Indeed, the Court recognized that when Congress \nwants to retroactively create continuity via an \nextension, it says so\u2014including by using modifiers like \n\u201cconsecutive\u201d or \u201csuccessive.\u201d  See id.  And Congress \nsaid nothing of the sort in \u00a7 2107(c).  So Rule 4(a)(5) \nmotions do not necessarily result in an unbroken \nappeal period any more than Rule 4(a)(6) motions do. \nEven if Rule 4(a)(5) relief did retroactively create a \nsingle, continuous appeal period, the Fourth Circuit \nlacked any basis for concluding that Rule 4(a)(6) relief \ndoes not operate in the same way.  Both Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) refer to reopening \u201cthe time \nfor appeal\u201d or \u201cthe time to file an appeal.\u201d  Insomuch \nas extensions result in a continuous appeal period, \nthat language suggests a continuous appeal period \nunder the reopening mechanism, too. \n\n33 \n \nb. The second faulty premise is that a notice of \nappeal can ripen only when it is retroactively deemed \nto have been filed during a continuous, unbroken \nappeal period.  The Fourth Circuit created that \ncontinuity requirement from whole cloth, with no \nbasis in text.  And that novel requirement contradicts \nthis Court\u2019s functional approach to notices of appeal. \nThe function of a notice of appeal\u2014as its name \nsuggests\u2014is to put courts and other parties on notice \nthat a litigant is pursuing an appeal.  See Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767; FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  A premature \nnotice plainly serves that function regardless of \nwhether the appeal period is later deemed to have \nbeen continuous all along.  After all, retroactively \ndeeming an extended appeal period to have been \ncontinuous \u201ccannot change the fact that, absent time \ntravel, a lapse or interruption has occurred.\u201d  \nHollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 392. \nMoreover, imposing a continuity requirement for \nripening would upset the longstanding consensus \namong Courts of Appeals that a notice of appeal filed \nbefore Rule 54(b) certification ripens once certification \nis obtained.  See supra, at 29\u201330.  And to the extent \nthis continuity requirement is jurisdictional, it \nthreatens the viability of Rule 4(a)(2) and Rule \n4(a)(4)(B)(i) as well.  In all of these contexts, the initial \nnotice is not filed within a continuous appeal period\u2014\nor, indeed, within any appeal period at all. \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s passing suggestion \nthat a single filing cannot serve as both a notice of \nappeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) motion is meritless.  See \nPet.App.3a\u20134a.  Indeed, this Court has already \nreversed the Fourth Circuit for making the same \n\n34 \n \nfundamental mistake in another case.  In Smith, this \nCourt held that even though the \u201cFederal Rules do \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings,\u201d the Rules \u201cdo not \npreclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  502 U.S. at 249.  \nA notice of appeal, in other words, need not be filed on \na separate piece of paper that serves no other purpose.  \nSee id.  That logic compels the conclusion that a notice \nof appeal can also serve as a motion to reopen.  See, \ne.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 669\u201370 (Winters\u2019s filing \u201cmay \nserve more than one function\u201d); Withers, 638 F.3d at \n1062 (\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 387 (rejecting the argument \nthat a Rule 4(a)(6) \u201cmotion . . . cannot be construed as \na notice of appeal\u201d). \nIV. THE CASE IS AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE. \nFinally, this case is an ideal vehicle for answering \nthe Question Presented.  The question whether a \nprematurely filed notice of appeal can ripen upon Rule \n4(a)(6) reopening was fully briefed and definitively \nanswered below.  And it was the sole ground for the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s ruling.  See Pet.App.2a (\u201cBecause \nDonte Parrish did not file a timely notice of appeal \nfrom the judgment in this civil action, we dismiss his \nappeal for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).   \nTo the extent the Government again sides with \nParrish on the merits, see Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, \nthat is no basis for declining review.  This Court \nregularly grants certiorari and appoints an amicus \ncuriae to defend a Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling where there \n\n35 \n \nis no dispute between the parties on the Question \nPresented.  See, e.g., Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, \n336 (2022); Lange v. California, 594 U.S. 295, 301 \n(2021); McLane Co. v.

This information is absolutely essential for understanding the core legal issues and the petitioner's strategy, forming the basis for any prediction. It is the single most important document to analyze at this stage.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because it reinforces a fundamental and highly effective strategy: prioritize the retrieval and analysis of primary source documents that frame the legal dispute. While not a novel technique, confirming the high utility of this step is crucial for refining a generalizable workflow for SCOTUS prediction, emphasizing the importance of starting with the petitioner's own words and arguments.\n\nJoint EIG is high because the action is critical for the specific task and also provides valuable reinforcement for the agent's overall strategic design.",

By diagnosing the previous search failures ('too brittle') and formulating a more robust plan ('a more general keyword search'), the agent significantly increases the probability of acquiring the necessary information in the next step. It's a high-value action for unblocking progress on the specific task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action is an excellent demonstration of a core design principle for a reasoning agent: self-reflection and adaptive strategy. The agent analyzes its failures and generates a new, improved heuristic ('when specific searches fail, broaden the query'). This is a highly generalizable lesson about effective information retrieval, making it very valuable for understanding and improving the agent's overall design.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The action is valuable on both fronts.

The Courts \nof Appeals have divided about whether a notice of \nappeal filed after the expiration of the ordinary appeal \nperiod but before the appeal period is reopened \nbecomes effective once reopening is granted.  \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n\n \nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \nDistrict Court and the appellant in the Court of \nAppeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the District Court and the appellee in the \nCourt of Appeals. \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nSTATEMENT OF RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  A petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on September 9, 2024, and this Court \ngranted certiorari on January 17, 2025.  This Court \nhas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n\u00a7 2107. Time for appeal to court of appeals \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or \nproceeding of a civil nature before a court of \nappeals for review unless notice of appeal is \nfiled, within thirty days after the entry of \nsuch judgment, order or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause.  In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after entry of the judgment \nor order or within 14 days after receipt of \nsuch notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the \ntime for appeal for a period of 14 days from \nthe date of entry of the order reopening the \ntime for appeal. \n[. . . .] \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules \n4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of \nappeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with \nthe district clerk within 30 days after entry of \nthe judgment or order appealed from. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n[. . . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a \ndecision or order\u2014but before the entry of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \njudgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time \notherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever \nperiod ends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within \nthe time allowed by those rules\u2014the time to \nfile an appeal runs for all parties from the \nentry of the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered.  \n(ii) A party intending to challenge an order \ndisposing of any motion listed in Rule \n4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment\u2019s alteration or \namendment upon such a motion, must file \na notice of appeal, or an amended notice of \nappeal\u2014in compliance with Rule 3(c)\u2014\nwithin the time prescribed by this Rule \nmeasured from the entry of the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion. \n[. . . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an \nAppeal. The district court may reopen the \ntime to file an appeal for a period of 14 days \nafter the date when its order to reopen is \nentered, but only if all the following \nconditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, \nwhichever is earlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n(7) Entry Defined. \n(A) A judgment or order is entered for \npurposes of this Rule 4(a): \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) does not require a separate \ndocument, when the judgment or order \nis entered in the civil docket under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); \nor \n(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) requires a separate document, \nwhen the judgment or order is entered \nin the civil docket under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the \nearlier of these events occurs: \n\u2022 the judgment or order is set forth on \na separate document, or \n\u2022 150 days have run from entry of the \njudgment or order in the civil docket \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n79(a). \n(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or \norder on a separate document when \nrequired \nby \nFederal \nRule \nof \nCivil \nProcedure 58(a) does not affect the \nvalidity of an appeal from that judgment \nor order. \n  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was being transferred \nfrom federal to state custody when the District Court \ndismissed his case.  As a result, he did not receive \nnotice of the judgment against him until well after the \ntime to appeal had expired.  Once he finally learned of \nthe judgment, Parrish filed a notice of appeal that \nexplained his delay.  The Court of Appeals construed \nthat notice as a motion to reopen the appeal period, \nand remanded so the District Court could rule on that \nmotion.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6).  On remand, the District Court found that \nall conditions for reopening were satisfied:  Parrish \nhad not received timely notice of the judgment, he had \npromptly moved for reopening, and no party would be \nprejudiced.  So it granted the motion, reopened the \nappeal period, and returned the case to the Court of \nAppeals. \nParrish had every reason to believe that his appeal \nwould proceed to the merits from there.  And in any \nother court it would have.  As other courts recognize, \npreviously filed notices of appeal \u201cripen\u201d when the \nappeal period reopens.  So the notice of appeal Parrish \nfiled before reopening was granted should have \nsufficed.  But the Fourth Circuit had other ideas.  It \nconcluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was both too \nlate (for the original appeal period) and too early (for \nthe reopened appeal period).  So, according to the \nFourth Circuit, Parrish needed to file a second notice \nof appeal\u2014this time, during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  Since he had not done that, the Fourth Circuit \ndismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThat was wrong.  There was no need for Parrish to \nfile a second notice of appeal, because his original one \nbecame effective when the appeal period reopened.  \nBoth this Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  Consistent with the functional \napproach, this Court has endorsed a \u201cgeneral \npractice\u201d\u2014reflected both in court decisions and the \nFederal Rules\u2014\u201cof deeming certain premature \nnotices of appeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvs. Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nCongress incorporated that background ripening \nprinciple into \u00a7 2107.  And its application to \u00a7 2107(c) \nyields a clear jurisdictional rule that avoids senseless \nresults.  Reopening is available only to litigants who \ndo not receive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(1).  Requiring those litigants to file a \nnotice of appeal within an even shorter, 14-day period \nwould render \u00a7 2107(c) ineffective for many (if not \nmost) of the litigants it serves.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s second-notice requirement has \nno basis in text, precedent, or common sense.  Its only \npurported \ntextual \ngrounding\u2014an \nattempted \ndistinction between \u201creopen\u201d and \u201cextend\u201d\u2014is both \nnonsensical and irreconcilable with HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 \nU.S. 382 (2021).  The court\u2019s alternative suggestion \nthat motions to reopen cannot also function as notices \nof app\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts \ncan reopen an expired appeal period when a party did \nnot receive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts \nof Appeals have divided about whether a notice of \nappeal filed after the expiration of the ordinary appeal \nperiod but before the appeal period is reopened \nbecomes effective once reopening is granted.  \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n\n \nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \nDistrict Court and the appellant in the Court of \nAppeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the District Court and the appellee in the \nCourt of Appeals. \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nSTATEMENT OF RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  A petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on September 9, 2024, and this Court \ngranted certiorari on January 17, 2025.  This Court \nhas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n\u00a7 2107. Time for appeal to court of appeals \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or \nproceeding of a civil nature before a court of \nappeals for review unless notice of appeal is \nfiled, within thirty days after the entry of \nsuch judgment, order or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause.  In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after entry of the judgment \nor order or within 14 days after receipt of \nsuch notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the \ntime for appeal for a period of 14 days from \nthe date of entry of the order reopening the \ntime for appeal. \n[. . . .] \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules \n4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of \nappeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with \nthe district clerk within 30 days after entry of \nthe judgment or order appealed from. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n[. . . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a \ndecision or order\u2014but before the entry of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \njudgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time \notherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever \nperiod ends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within \nthe time allowed by those rules\u2014the time to \nfile an appeal runs for all parties from the \nentry of the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered.  \n(ii) A party intending to challenge an order \ndisposing of any motion listed in Rule \n4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment\u2019s alteration or \namendment upon such a motion, must file \na notice of appeal, or an amended notice of \nappeal\u2014in compliance with Rule 3(c)\u2014\nwithin the time prescribed by this Rule \nmeasured from the entry of the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion. \n[. . . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an \nAppeal. The district court may reopen the \ntime to file an appeal for a period of 14 days \nafter the date when its order to reopen is \nentered, but only if all the following \nconditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, \nwhichever is earlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n(7) Entry Defined. \n(A) A judgment or order is entered for \npurposes of this Rule 4(a): \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) does not require a separate \ndocument, when the judgment or order \nis entered in the civil docket under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); \nor \n(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) requires a separate document, \nwhen the judgment or order is entered \nin the civil docket under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the \nearlier of these events occurs: \n\u2022 the judgment or order is set forth on \na separate document, or \n\u2022 150 days have run from entry of the \njudgment or order in the civil docket \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n79(a). \n(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or \norder on a separate document when \nrequired \nby \nFederal \nRule \nof \nCivil \nProcedure 58(a) does not affect the \nvalidity of an appeal from that judgment \nor order. \n  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was being transferred \nfrom federal to state custody when the District Court \ndismissed his case.  As a result, he did not receive \nnotice of the judgment against him until well after the \ntime to appeal had expired.  Once he finally learned of \nthe judgment, Parrish filed a notice of appeal that \nexplained his delay.  The Court of Appeals construed \nthat notice as a motion to reopen the appeal period, \nand remanded so the District Court could rule on that \nmotion.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6).  On remand, the District Court found that \nall conditions for reopening were satisfied:  Parrish \nhad not received timely notice of the judgment, he had \npromptly moved for reopening, and no party would be \nprejudiced.  So it granted the motion, reopened the \nappeal period, and returned the case to the Court of \nAppeals. \nParrish had every reason to believe that his appeal \nwould proceed to the merits from there.  And in any \nother court it would have.  As other courts recognize, \npreviously filed notices of appeal \u201cripen\u201d when the \nappeal period reopens.  So the notice of appeal Parrish \nfiled before reopening was granted should have \nsufficed.  But the Fourth Circuit had other ideas.  It \nconcluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was both too \nlate (for the original appeal period) and too early (for \nthe reopened appeal period).  So, according to the \nFourth Circuit, Parrish needed to file a second notice \nof appeal\u2014this time, during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  Since he had not done that, the Fourth Circuit \ndismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThat was wrong.  There was no need for Parrish to \nfile a second notice of appeal, because his original one \nbecame effective when the appeal period reopened.  \nBoth this Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  Consistent with the functional \napproach, this Court has endorsed a \u201cgeneral \npractice\u201d\u2014reflected both in court decisions and the \nFederal Rules\u2014\u201cof deeming certain premature \nnotices of appeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvs. Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nCongress incorporated that background ripening \nprinciple into \u00a7 2107.  And its application to \u00a7 2107(c) \nyields a clear jurisdictional rule that avoids senseless \nresults.  Reopening is available only to litigants who \ndo not receive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(1).  Requiring those litigants to file a \nnotice of appeal within an even shorter, 14-day period \nwould render \u00a7 2107(c) ineffective for many (if not \nmost) of the litigants it serves.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s second-notice requirement has \nno basis in text, precedent, or common sense.  Its only \npurported \ntextual \ngrounding\u2014an \nattempted \ndistinction between \u201creopen\u201d and \u201cextend\u201d\u2014is both \nnonsensical and irreconcilable with HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 \nU.S. 382 (2021).  The court\u2019s alternative suggestion \nthat motions to reopen cannot also function as notices \nof appeal is foreclosed by Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244 \n(1992).   \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal ripened when the appeal \nperiod reopened.  No second notice was required.  This \nCourt should reverse the decision below and remand \nfor a ruling on the merits. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 governs the \u201ctime for appeal\u201d in \ncivil cases.  Subsection (a) requires appellants to file \nnotices of appeal \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof\u201d the \u201cjudgment, order or decree\u201d they seek to \nchallenge.  Subsection (b) provides a longer \u201ctime\u201d\u2014\n\u201c60 days from such entry\u201d\u2014if the parties include the \nUnited States, a federal agency, or certain federal \nofficers.  Subsection (c) provides that those default \nappeal periods can be extended or reopened based on \nextenuating circumstances.  \nSection 2107(c) consists of two sentences.  The first \nsentence provides that district courts may \u201cextend the \ntime for appeal\u201d \u201cupon motion filed not later than 30 \ndays after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2107(c).  That relief is \navailable upon \u201ca showing of excusable neglect or good \ncause.\u201d  Id.  The second sentence states that district \ncourts may \u201creopen the time for appeal for a period of \n14 days\u201d \u201cupon motion filed within 180 days after \nentry of the judgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier.\u201d  Id.  That \nrelief is available upon a finding that (1) the appellant \ndid not receive notice of the order in question \u201cwithin \n21 days of its entry\u201d and (2) \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2107(c)(1)\u2013(2).   \nAppellate Rules 4(a)(5) and (a)(6) implement \n\u00a7 2107(c).  Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first \nsentence.  Subsection (A) restates the statutory timing \nand \u201cgood cause\u201d requirements; subsection (B) \naddresses ex parte motions; and subsection (C) \n\n \n11 \n \n \nprovides that \u201c[n]o extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) \nmay exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting the \nmotion is entered, whichever is later.\u201d  Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(5).  Appellate Rule 4(a)(6), which governs \n\u201cReopening the Time to File an Appeal,\u201d implements \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.  It provides that district \ncourts \u201cmay reopen the time to file an appeal for a \nperiod of 14 days\u201d when \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s notice, timing, and \nprejudice requirements are satisfied.  Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. Factual Background \nDonte Parrish alleges that he spent years in harsh, \npunitive segregation for a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cCir.App.\u201d) at 84.  It all \nstarted when the Bureau of Prisons charged Parrish \nwith killing another inmate during a prison riot, as \nwell as with being present in an unauthorized area \nduring the same event.  See id.  Prison officials refused \nto provide Parrish with a hearing or other meaningful \nopportunity to contest those charges.  See Cir.App.31\u2013\n32, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355.  Nevertheless, they moved him \ninto segregation while the FBI commenced an \ninvestigation that took nearly six years to complete.  \nCir.App.31, 63, 84.   \nDuring most of his time in segregation, Parrish was \nisolated in a small cell.  Cir.App.34.  He was denied \naccess to his property, lost law library privileges, was \ndenied family visits, had difficulty contacting his \nlawyer, and was denied access to showers.  See \nCir.App.43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes restrained and \nforced to sleep in shackles.  Cir.App.74.  At one point, \n\n \n12 \n \n \nhe \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  Cir.App.45, 74.   \nParrish spent almost two years of his time in \nsegregation in FCI Lewisburg\u2019s Special Management \nUnit, Cir.App.44\u201345, which has been described as \u201cthe \nworst place in the federal prison system.\u201d1  After an \ninvestigation, the Office of the Inspector General \nconcluded that the unit\u2019s use of solitary confinement \nwas \u201cparticularly concerning.\u201d2  The Bureau of \nPrisons announced the unit\u2019s shutdown soon after \nthat OIG report was released.3 \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  Cir.App.63.  \nAfter he had spent nearly three years in segregation, \nthe Bureau of Prisons found that Parrish had \ncommitted \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged his \ndisciplinary record.  Cir.App.63, 77.   \n \n1 Justin Peters, How America\u2019s Model Prison Became the Most \nHorrific Facility in the Federal System, SLATE (Nov. 20, 2013), \nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-\nspecial-management-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-\nthe-most-horrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html (reporting \nthat inmates in the unit spent \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in cells \n\u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the same \ntime\u201d). \n2 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, \n17-05, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Use of Restrictive \nHousing for Inmates with Mental Illness 15\u201318 (2017), \nhttps://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf. \n3 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, \n24-113, Inspection of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Federal \nCorrectional \nInstitution \nLewisburg \n3 \nn.1 \n(2024), \nhttps://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/24-113.pdf. \n\n \n13 \n \n \nC. Procedural History \n1. \nParrish \nprepared \na \ncomplaint \nseeking \ncompensation for the years he had wrongfully spent in \nsegregation.  Cir.App.16\u201325, 132\u201334.  He signed the \ncomplaint and delivered it for mailing on April 7, \n2017.  Cir.App.22, 106.  The District Court received \nthat complaint and deemed it filed on May 3, 2017, \nnearly a month later.  Cir.App.25. \nThe District Court dismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an \nopinion and order dated March 23, 2020, and a \njudgment dated March 24, 2020.  Pet.App.55a, 57a, \n59a.  The court mailed both documents to USP \nThomson, the federal prison where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But by \nthat point, Parrish was in the process of being \ntransferred from federal to state custody.  Id. at 60a\u2013\n61a; D.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address); \nsee also Sentencing Memorandum of United States at \n4, Dkt. No. 147, United States v. Parrish, No. 05-cr-\n417 (M.D. Pa.

Dkt. No. 132).  But \u201cthe \n[order] was returned as undelivered . . . .\u201d  Id.   \nParrish promptly filed a notice of change of address.  \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (April 14, 2020).  He then filed a \nsecond notice, along with a note \u201crequesting a docket \nsheet.\u201d  D.Ct. Dkt. No. 134 (June 9, 2020).  Upon \nreceiving the docket sheet, Parrish realized \u201cthat [his] \nlawsuit ha[d] been denied.\u201d  D.Ct. Dkt. No. 135 (June \n23, 2020).  So he filed a letter asking for \u201ca copy of the \n\n \n14 \n \n \njudge[\u2019]s last ruling sent to [his] new address.\u201d  Id.  In \nthe end, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nagainst him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat the earliest,\u201d \nPet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its entry and \nlong after the 60-day appeal period had expired, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted quickly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  On July 8, 2020, he filed a \ndocument entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; \nsee also D.Ct. Dkt. No. 131-1 (envelope).  In that \ndocument, Parrish explained the reason for his \ndelayed filing:  \u201cDue to my being transferred from \nFederal to State custody I did not receive this order \nuntil June 25, 2020.  It is now 7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this \nnotice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit \nconstrued the notice of appeal as a motion to reopen \nthe appeal period and remanded for the District Court \nto rule on that motion.  Pet.App.56a\u201358a.   \nOn remand, the District Court found that Parrish \nhad received notice of the judgment more than 21 days \nafter its entry, that he had moved for reopening within \n14 days of receiving notice, and that no party would \nbe prejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at \n61a (citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  The District Court \ntherefore reopened the appeal period for 14 days.  Id. \nat 61a\u201362a.  It further directed the clerk to \n\u201csupplement [the] record accordingly, and transmit \nthe same to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a.4 \n \n4 The District Court\u2019s reopening order contains a typo \nsuggesting that reopening was granted on January 8, 2020.  \nPet.App.62a.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, reopening was \nactually granted on January 8, 2021.  See Pet.App.5a.   \n\n \n15 \n \n \n3. Parrish\u2019s appeal thus returned to the Fourth \nCircuit.  There, both Parrish and the Government \nagreed that Parrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had \nbecome effective when the District Court reopened the \nappeal period.  See Ct.App. Dkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) \nat 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1.  That is how \nother appellate courts treat notices of appeal filed \nafter the ordinary appeal period has expired but \nbefore reopening is granted.  See Winters v. Taskila, \n88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nWithers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th Cir. 2011); \nHolden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 WL 274489, \nat *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022); Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., 825 F. App\u2019x 383, 386\u201387 (7th Cir. 2020); \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998).   \nA divided panel of the Fourth Circuit rejected that \nconsensus position.  The panel majority acknowledged \nthat notices of appeal filed after the ordinary appeal \nperiod expires ripen when a district court grants an \nextension \nunder \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nfirst \nsentence.  \nPet.App.11a.  It reasoned, however, that the word \n\u201creopen\u201d precludes a previously filed notice of appeal \nfrom ripening when a district court grants reopening \nunder \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.  See id. at 5a\u20136a, \n9a\u201312a.  The panel majority also suggested that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s earlier filing\u201d could no longer serve as a \nnotice of appeal because it \u201cha[d] already been \nconstrued\u201d as a motion to reopen.  Id. at 3a\u20134a.  The \nmajority thus deemed Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal \nineffective.  And because Parrish had not filed a \nsecond notice of appeal during the 14-day reopening \n\n \n16 \n \n \nwindow, it dismissed his appeal for lack of \njurisdiction.  Pet.App.2a.   \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He found \nno second-notice \u201crequirement in the text of \n\u00a7 2107(c),\u201d id. at 18a, and would have held that \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal ripened when reopening was \ngranted.  See id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory \nopined that the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted distinction\u201d \nbetween reopening an appeal period and extending it \n\u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 20a.  He also \nrejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \u201cParrish\u2019s July \n2020 filing cannot simultaneously serve as both a \nnotice of appeal and a motion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  The panel denied rehearing over Judge \nGregory\u2019s dissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the \nFourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of \n9-to-6.  Id. at 63a\u201364a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a \nstatement in support of the en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u2013\n67a.  Judge Gregory, joined by three other judges, \nwrote a dissent.  Id. at 67a\u201369a.  \u201cAt its core,\u201d the \ndissenters explained, \u201cthis case requires us to \ndetermine whether access to [appellate courts] should \nbe foreclosed for failure to refile a notice of appeal \nduring the newly reopened period following success \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a. The panel\u2019s ruling, the \ndissenters recognized, had created a circuit \u201csplit.\u201d  Id. \nat 68a.  And it will have a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects,\u201d often denying them any meaningful \nopportunity to appeal.  Id. at 68a\u201369a.   \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Notices of appeal filed after the original appeal \nperiod expires ripen when the appeal period reopens. \nA. This Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  So long as notices of appeal afford \nadequate notice, purely technical defects do not \nrender them ineffective.  For decades, courts\u2014\nincluding this Court\u2014have taken the same functional \napproach to notices of appeal that are filed too early.  \nPremature notices usually afford more notice, not \nless.  As a result, they generally ripen when an appeal \nperiod opens.  That ripening principle is reflected in \nthe Federal Rules.  In fact, it is so well established \nthat rulemakers expressly disclaim it where it does \nnot apply. \nB. Section 2107 incorporates the same ripening \nprinciple.  Nothing in \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s text requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative notice of appeal after the \nappeal period reopens.  To the contrary, \u00a7 2107(c) \nincorporates the notice of appeal requirement set \nforth in \u00a7 2107(a), which provides that a notice of \nappeal need only be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after\u201d the \norder on appeal\u2014i.e., before the jurisdictional \ndeadline.  Ordinary ripening rules apply to notices of \nappeal filed before the \u00a7 2107(a) clock starts ticking.  \nThere is no textual basis for treating \u00a7 2107(c) any \ndifferently.  Indeed, historical context confirms that \npremature notices of appeal ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nsecond sentence, just as they do under the statute\u2019s \nother provisions.  The \u201cno prejudice\u201d standard baked \ninto \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s text captures the ripening principle \nperfectly.    \n\n \n18 \n \n \nC. Applying the ripening principle results in a clear \nand sensible jurisdictional rule.  Litigants that benefit \nfrom reopening orders are almost always incarcerated \npeople acting pro se\u2014a category of litigants that often \nfails to receive timely notice of court orders due to \ncircumstances far beyond their control.  A second-\nnotice requirement is a tripwire that pro se litigants \n(and even lawyers) may fail to spot.  And even those \nwho realize that a second notice is required may have \nno way to file one during the 14-day reopening \nwindow.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule, those \nlitigants will lose their right to appeal through no \nfault of their own\u2014and for no conceivable reason, \nsince reopening can be granted only when \u201cno party \n[will] be prejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nII. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s justifications for its second-\nnotice requirement fall flat. \nA. The Fourth Circuit primarily relied on an \nattempted distinction between the word \u201creopen\u201d and \nthe word \u201cextend.\u201d  According to the court, notices of \nappeal ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence because \nan \u201cextension\u201d retroactively creates a continuous \nappeal period, but they do not ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nsecond \nsentence \nbecause \n\u201creopening\u201d \nworks \ndifferently.  That logic fails at every step.  Ripening \ndoes not hinge on the fiction that an untimely notice \nof appeal was timely all along.  That is not how \nextensions work, in any event:  Like reopening \nmotions, extension motions can be granted either \nbefore or after the original appeal period expires.  \nCongress\u2019s use of different terms merely reflects the \nobvious differences between the two mechanisms.  \nThere is no way to read the word \u201creopen\u201d as implicitly \ndislodging the ripening principle that applies in every \n\n \n19 \n \n \nother context\u2014much less as imposing a second-notice \nrequirement for reopening only.   \nB. The Fourth Circuit also briefly suggested that \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal could no longer be \nconsidered a notice of appeal once it had been \nconstrued as a motion to reopen.  Apparently, the \nFourth Circuit doesn\u2019t think a single filing can work \ntwo jobs at once.  This Court has already held, \nhowever, that notices of appeal can do exactly that.   \nARGUMENT \nI. \nNOTICES \nOF APPEAL FILED AFTER \nTHE \nORDINARY APPEAL PERIOD EXPIRES RIPEN \nWHEN THE APPEAL PERIOD IS REOPENED. \nNotices of appeal that are filed too early generally \nbecome effective when an appeal clock starts running.  \nThat background ripening principle\u2014which follows \nfrom the functional approach to notices of appeal\u2014is \nreflected both in caselaw and in the Federal Rules.  \nCongress baked it into \u00a7 2107\u2019s text.  And it yields a \nsimple, workable rule that avoids stripping pro se \nlitigants of their right to appeal and prejudices no one.  \nA. Premature notices of appeal generally \ntake effect when an appeal period \nopens. \nCourts and rulemakers take a functional approach \nto notices of appeal, particularly for pro se litigants.  \nConsistent with that approach, this Court and others \nhave long recognized\u2014across a wide variety of \ncontexts\u2014that premature notices of appeal generally \n\n \n20 \n \n \nripen when an appeal period begins.  That background \nprinciple is also reflected in the Federal Rules.   \n1. Notices of appeal serve an important purpose:  \nThey inform parties and courts that a particular \nlitigant wishes to challenge a particular court order.  \nSee Smith, 502 U.S. at 248.  But the notice-of-appeal \nrequirement is not meant to be a landmine.  \n\u201c[I]mperfect . . . compliance\u201d with formal rules is not \ndisqualifying.  Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 \nU.S. 312, 315 (1988); see also Hoiness v. United States, \n335 U.S. 297, 300 (1948) (explaining that \u201cniceties of \nform\u201d are immaterial and \u201cdefect[s] . . . of . . . a \ntechnical nature\u201d should be \u201cdisregarded\u201d); Fed. R. \nApp. P. 3(c)(7) (\u201cAn appeal must not be dismissed for \ninformality of form or title of the notice of appeal, for \nfailure to name a party whose intent to appeal is \notherwise clear from the notice, or for failure to \nproperly designate the judgment if the notice of \nappeal was filed after entry of the judgment and \ndesignates \nan \norder \nthat \nmerged \ninto \nthat \njudgment.\u201d). \nA notice of appeal is fit for purpose so long as it \nactually provides adequate notice.  See Smith, 502 \nU.S. at 248 (\u201c[T]he notice afforded by a document . . . \ndetermines the document\u2019s sufficiency as a notice of \nappeal.\u201d).  To do that, a notice of appeal need only \nleave \u201cno genuine doubt . . . about who is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, [and] to which appellate court.\u201d  \nBecker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 767 (2001) \n(reversing court of appeals for dismissing an appeal \nbecause the appellant had failed to sign the notice of \nappeal); see also Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181 \n(1962) (notice of appeal sufficient where \u201cpetitioner\u2019s \nintention to seek review of\u201d particular judgments \u201cwas \n\n \n21 \n \n \nmanifest\u201d); Hoiness, 335 U.S. at 301 (notice of appeal \nsufficient where \u201c[w]hat appellant sought to have \nreviewed was plain\u201d).   \nThe functional approach to notices of appeal echoes \nbroader requirements that courts elevate function \nover form.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 61 \nprovides that, \u201c[a]t every stage of the proceeding, the \ncourt must disregard all errors and defects that do not \naffect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 61.  And first among all Rules of Civil Procedure is \nthe general principle that Rules \u201cshould be construed, \nadministered, and employed by the court and the \nparties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive \ndetermination of every action and proceeding.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 1.  \u201cIt is . . . entirely contrary to the spirit of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on \nthe merits to be avoided on the basis of . . . mere \ntechnicalities.\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 181. \nThe functional approach to notices of appeal also \nfollows from this Court\u2019s consistent refrain that pro se \nfilings must be construed generously.  See, e.g., \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per \ncuriam) (\u201cA document filed pro se is \u2018to be liberally \nconstrued[.]\u2019\u201d (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, \n106 (1976))).  Most of this Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional \napproach\u201d cases have involved notices of appeal filed \nby pro se litigants.  This Court has always afforded \nthose notices of appeal the same liberal construction \nit affords other pro se filings.  See, e.g., Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248\u201350 (construing \u201cinformal brief\u201d filed \nby pro se litigant as a notice of appeal); Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767\u201368 (deeming pro se notice of appeal \nsufficient even though unsigned); cf. also Houston v. \nLack, 487 U.S. 266, 270 (1988) (holding that a notice \n\n \n22 \n \n \nof appeal filed by an incarcerated pro se litigant is \nsufficient if delivered to prison authorities by the \njurisdictional deadline); Fallen v. United States, 378 \nU.S. 139, 142\u201344 (1964) (similar). \n2. This Court has applied this same functional \napproach to premature notices of appeal.  In FirsTier, \nthis Court considered a notice of appeal filed \u201cafter the \nDistrict Court announced from the bench that it \nintended to grant summary judgment for respondent, \nbut before entry of judgment.\u201d  498 U.S. at 270.  The \nquestion before the Court was whether that notice \nwas \u201cfatally premature,\u201d given that the appeal period \ndid not begin running until judgment was entered.  Id. \nat 272.  The answer was no.  See id. at 273\u201374.  \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca notice of appeal \u2018filed after the announcement \nof a decision or order but before the entry of the \njudgment or order shall be treated as filed after such \nentry and on the day thereof.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 272\u201373 (quoting \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2)).  As the Court recognized, that \nRule reflects \u201ca general practice in the courts of \nappeals of deeming certain premature notices of \nappeal effective.\u201d  Id. at 273 (citing, e.g., In re Grand \nJury Impaneled Jan. 21, 1975, 541 F.2d 373, 377 (3d \nCir. 1976)).  This Court endorsed that practice, \nholding that \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity . . . \nshould not be allowed to extinguish an otherwise \nproper appeal\u201d when it \u201cdo[es] not prejudice the \nappellee.\u201d  Id.; see also id. at 274\u201375 (rejecting the \nargument that this practice \u201cenlarg[ed] appellate \njurisdiction\u201d). \nFirsTier variously described the premature-notice \nprinciple in terms of \u201cripen[ing],\u201d \u201crelat[ion] forward,\u201d \nand becoming \u201ceffective.\u201d  Id. at 275, 277.  However \n\n \n23 \n \n \nlabeled, the principle has been applied \u201cquite \ngenerally\u201d in civil cases for decades.  Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdvisory Committee Notes on 1979 Amendment.  See, \ne.g., United States v. Valdosta-Lowndes Cnty. Hosp. \nAuth., 668 F.2d 1177, 1178 n.2 (11th Cir. 1982) (notice \nfiled after entry of judgment but before decision on \nJNOV motion); Tilden Fin. Corp v. Palo Tire Serv., \nInc., 596 F.2d 604, 606\u201307 (3d Cir. 1979) (notice filed \nbefore appellant obtained Rule 54(b) certification); \nRicherson v. Jones, 551 F.2d 918, 922\u201323 (3d Cir. \n1977) (notice filed after merits ruling but before ruling \non attorney\u2019s fees); Jetco Elec. Indus. v. Gardiner, 473 \nF.2d 1228, 1231 (5th Cir. 1973) (notice filed after entry \nof judgment against appellant but before resolution of \nclaims against other parties); Morris v. Uhl & Lopez \nEng\u2019rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247, 1250\u201351 (10th Cir. 1971) \n(same, in slightly different configuration); Merchants \n& Planters Bank v. Smith, 516 F.2d 355, 356 n.3 (8th \nCir. 1975) (same, in slightly different configuration); \nEason v. Dickson, 390 F.2d 585, 587\u201388 (9th Cir. 1968) \n(notice filed after denial of motion to convene three-\njudge district court, which appellant believed disposed \nof his claims on the merits); Markham v. Holt, \n369 F.2d 940, 941\u201342 (5th Cir. 1966) (notice filed after \nentry of order granting summary judgment but before \nentry of judgment).   \nThis Court applied the same principle in the \ncriminal context more than three-quarters of a \ncentury ago.  In Lemke v. United States, 346 U.S. 325 \n(1953) (per curiam), the defendant filed a notice of \nappeal on March 11, but judgment was not entered \nuntil March 14.  See id. at 326.  \u201cSince no notice of \nappeal was filed after that time,\u201d the lower court \n\u201cdismissed [the appeal] as premature.\u201d  Id.  This Court \n\n \n24 \n \n \nreversed that ruling and reinstated the appeal.  \u201cThe \nnotice of appeal filed on March 11,\u201d it recognized, \u201cwas \n. . . still on file on March 14 and gave full notice after \nthat date, as well as before, of the sentence and \njudgment which petitioner challenged.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe notice of appeal\u2019s \u201cirregularity\u201d did \u201cnot affect \nsubstantial rights,\u201d it was sufficient.  Id. (quoting Fed. \nR. Crim. P. 52(a)).5   \n3. By 1979, the ripening principle was so well \nestablished that rulemakers had to expressly \nenumerate circumstances in which premature notices \nshould not be allowed to ripen.  That year, the Rules \nCommittee amended Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) to provide \nthat \u201c[a] notice of appeal filed before the disposition of \n[certain post-judgment motions] shall have no effect.\u201d  \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) (1979); see Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdv. Comm. Notes on 1993 Amendment (discussing \nthe 1979 rule).  Prior to that amendment, courts of \nappeals had generally treated such notices as \nsufficient, recognizing that they ripened once post-\njudgment motions were resolved.  See Acosta v. La. \nDep\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs., 478 U.S. 251, 254 \n(1986) (per curiam) (explaining that the amended \nRule created an exception to the \u201cgeneral rule that a \nnotice of appeal filed after announcement of an order \nbut before its entry in the docket will be deemed \ntimely filed\u201d); Williams v. Bolger, 633 F.2d 410, 412 \n(5th Cir. 1980) (acknowledging that the amendment \nhad \u201coverrule[d] several\u201d of the court\u2019s \u201cprevious \ndecisions\u201d).  But changes to appeal-docketing \n \n5 As this Court recognized in Manrique v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 116 (2017), \u201cthe Lemke petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal would \nnow be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).\u201d  Id. at 125.   \n\n \n25 \n \n \nprocedures had resulted in a \u201cbroad class of situations \n. . . in which district courts and courts of appeals \nwould both have had the power to modify the same \njudgment.\u201d  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount \nCo., 459 U.S. 56, 59\u201360 (1982).  \u201cThe 1979 \nAmendments avoided that potential conflict\u201d by \ntreating a notice of appeal as void\u2014i.e., \u201cas if no notice \nof appeal [had been] filed at all\u201d\u2014once certain post-\njudgment motions were filed.  Id. at 60, 61.   \nAt the same time it amended Rule 4(a)(4) to \npreclude ripening in some contexts, the Rules \nCommittee added Rule 4(a)(2), which expressly \nprovided for ripening in others.  That provision, which \n\u201ccodif[ied]\u201d existing practice in part, FirsTier, 498 U.S. \nat 273, states that \u201c[a] notice of appeal filed after the \ncourt announces a decision or order\u2014but before the \nentry of the judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on \nthe date of and after the entry,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. Notes (1979) \n(citing, as examples of the particular application of \nripening it acknowledged, In re Grand Jury, 541 F.2d \n373; Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87 (3d Cir. 1976); Song \nJook Suh v. Rosenberg, 437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); \nRuby v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, 365 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); \nand Firchau v. Diamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269 \n(9th Cir. 1965)). \nRule 4(a)(2)\u2019s ripening provision survives today.  \nRule 4(a)(4)\u2019s anti-ripening exception does not.  In \n1993, the Rules Committee amended Rule 4(a)(4) to \nrestore the ripening principle\u2019s applicability to post-\njudgment motions.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1993).  As the Committee recognized, \u201c[m]any \nlitigants, especially pro se litigants,\u201d had \u201cfail[ed] to \nfile the second notice of appeal\u201d the Rule required\u2014\n\n \n26 \n \n \nand so had lost the opportunity to appeal.  Id.; see \nAverhart v. Arredondo, 773 F.2d 919, 920 (7th Cir. \n1985) (Posner, J.) (recognizing that such mistakes are \n\u201cthoroughly understandable,\u201d because \u201c[t]he idea that \nthe first notice of appeal lapses . . . is not intuitive\u201d).  \nRule 4(a)(4)(B)(i) now expressly incorporates the \nripening principle, providing that notices of appeal \nfiled \u201cafter the court announces or enters a \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of [post-judgment \nmotions]\u2014 . . . become[ ] effective . . . when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining motion is \nentered.\u201d   \nThe Rules\u2019 brief dalliance with a narrow exception \nto the ripening principle had no effect on the \nprinciple\u2019s application in other contexts.  Courts \ncontinued to treat other premature notices of appeal \nas sufficient even while the anti-ripening version of \nRule 4(a)(4) was in effect.  See, e.g., Alcorn County v. \nU.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1166 \n(5th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[A] premature notice of appeal does \ninvoke appellate jurisdiction except in the narrow \ncircumstances described in Rule 4(a)(4).\u201d); Cape May \nGreene, Inc. v. Warren, 698 F.2d 179, 185 (3d Cir. \n1983) (\u201c[T]he prohibition against giving effect to \npremature notices of appeal shall be confined to the \nspecific instances cited in Rule 4(a)(4).\u201d).   \nNor has the Rules\u2019 express incorporation of the \nripening principle in some contexts limited its \napplication in others.  Indeed, courts consistently \nacknowledge that notices of appeal filed too early \nripen in circumstances not expressly contemplated by \nthe Rules.  For example, notices of appeal filed after \nan interlocutory order but before Rule 54(b) \ncertification ripen when the order is certified.  See, \n\n \n27 \n \n \ne.g., Clausen v. SEA-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1184\u201385 \n(1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases from Second, Fourth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits); \nLiberty Bell Bank v. Rogers, 726 F. App\u2019x 147, 150 n.5 \n(3d Cir. 2018); Swope v. Columbian Chems. Co., 281 \nF.3d 185, 191\u201394 (5th Cir. 2002); Good v. Ohio Edison \nCo., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Wilson v. Navistar \nInt\u2019l Transp. Corp., 193 F.3d 1212, 1213 (11th Cir. \n1999).  And notices of appeal filed after the original \nappeal period expires ripen when the appeal period is \nextended under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence.  See Moore \nv. Nelson, 611 F.2d 434, 436 n.4 (2d Cir. 1979); Evans \nv. Jones, 366 F.2d 772, 773 (4th Cir. 1966); Cuevas v. \nReading & Bates Corp., 770 F.2d 1371, 1375, 1377 \n(5th Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds, In re Air \nCrash Disaster Near New Orleans, 821 F.2d 1147, \n1163 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc); Van Orman v. \nPurkett, 43 F.3d 1201, 1202 (8th Cir. 1994); United \nStates v. Layton, 855 F.2d 1388, 1416 (9th Cir. 1988); \nN. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., \n527 F.3d 1033, 1039 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Consol. \nFreightways Corp. of Del. v. Larson, 827 F.2d 916, 921 \n(3d Cir. 1987). \nB. Section \n2107(c) \nincorporates \nthat \nripening principle. \nSection 2107(c) was enacted in 1991, right on \nFirsTier\u2019s heels and after the ripening principle had \nbeen established for decades.  See Pub. L. 102-198, \n\u00a7 12 (Dec. 9, 1991); supra 22\u201327.  The provision\u2019s text, \nstructure, and history all indicate that the reopening \nmechanism incorporates the background ripening \nprinciple.  Like other premature notices of appeal that \nprovide adequate notice, notices of appeal filed after \n\n \n28 \n \n \nthe original appeal period expires take effect when the \nappeal period is reopened. \nText. Jurisdictional requirements spring only from \nclear statements in statutory text.  See, e.g., Wilkins \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 152, 158\u201360 (2023) (courts \napply \u201cthe jurisdictional label\u201d only when Congress \nhas made a \u201cclear statement\u201d that a provision \u201ctruly \noperates as a limit on a court\u2019s subject-matter \njurisdiction\u201d); Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., \n583 U.S. 17, 19 (2017) (\u201c[A] time limit prescribed only \nin a court-made rule . . . is not jurisdictional.\u201d).  \nSection 2107(c) authorizes courts to \u201creopen the time \nfor appeal for a period of 14 days from the date of entry \nof the order reopening the time for appeal.\u201d  The \nprovision contains no statement\u2014much less a clear \none\u2014that appellate courts lack jurisdiction unless an \nappellant files a notice of appeal after reopening.  \nSection 2107(c) does not even mention notices of \nappeal.  Nor does it say anything about what \nappellants must do during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  In the absence of a clear statement, there can \nbe no jurisdictional requirement that litigants who \nhave already filed an otherwise-sufficient notice of \nappeal file a second one during the reopening window. \nStructure. Section 2107\u2019s broader structure \nconfirms that subsection (c) incorporates the ripening \ndefault rule.  Subsection (a) creates the notice-of-\nappeal requirement; subsections (b) and (c) simply set \ndifferent deadlines for completing that requirement.  \nRipening is available under subsections (a) and (b).  \nThe notice-of-appeal requirement must mean the \nsame thing for subsection (c).  \n\n \n29 \n \n \nSubsection (c) does not itself set out a requirement \nto file a notice of appeal.  It provides only for reopening \nof \u201cthe time for appeal.\u201d  The obligation to file a notice \nof appeal comes from subsection (a), which contains \n\u00a7 2107\u2019s \nonly \nreference \nto \nnotices \nof \nappeal.  \nSubsection (a) requires that a notice of appeal be filed \n\u201cwithin thirty days after the entry of\u201d the decision at \nissue, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section.\u201d \nSubsections (b) and (c) provide otherwise.  Both \nsubsections \nincorporate \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement in subsection (a), but they set different \ndeadlines in certain categories of cases.  Where \nsubsection (b) applies, \u201cthe time\u201d is \u201c60 days from such \nentry.\u201d  And under subsection (c), courts may \u201cextend \nthe time for appeal\u201d or \u201creopen the time for appeal for \na period of 14 days.\u201d  In both provisions, \u201cthe time\u201d \nand \u201cthe time for appeal\u201d refer back to the only \ncomplete \nstatement \nof \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement in \u00a7 2107: subsection (a)\u2019s requirement \nthat a notice of appeal be filed \u201cwithin thirty days \nafter\u201d an order\u2019s entry.   \nThe operative language in subsection (a)\u2014\u201cwithin \n30 days after the entry\u201d\u2014is consistent with the \nripening principle.  That phrase specifies both the \nlatest time a notice of appeal can be filed and the event \nfrom which that deadline is measured.  When used in \nthe deadline context, the preposition \u201cwithin\u201d means \n\u201cbefore the end of.\u201d  \u201cWithin,\u201d Merriam-Webster \n(2025); see also \u201cWithin,\u201d Collins Dictionary (2025) \n(\u201cnot beyond in distance, time, degree, range, scope, \netc.\u201d); \u201cWithin,\u201d Oxford English Dictionary (2025) (\u201cIn \nthe limits of (a period of time); most usually, before \nthe end of, after not more than\u201d; \u201cNot beyond or above \n(a specified or implied amount or degree); at, in, or of \n\n \n30 \n \n \nless than or not more than; so as not to exceed or \nsurpass\u201d); Cambridge English Dictionary, English \nGrammar Today (\u201cWithin stresses that something is \n. . . \nnot \nlater \nthan \na \nparticular \ntime.\u201d), \nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-\ngrammar/within.  So in subsection (a), \u201cwithin\u201d sets \nthe date by which a notice of appeal must be filed.  \nAnd the phrase \u201cafter the entry\u201d anchors that \ndeadline to a specific point in time\u2014i.e., it tells you \nwhich day to start counting. \nThe notice-of-appeal requirement in subsection (a) \nis therefore consistent with ripening.  Notices of \nappeal are filed \u201cwithin\u201d the appeal period so long as \nthey are filed before the deadline.  See Smith, 502 U.S. \nat 248\u201349 (\u201cIf a document filed within the time \nspecified by Rule 4 gives the notice required by Rule \n3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.\u201d).  That is just as \ntrue for premature notices of appeal as it is for notices \nof appeal filed after the appeal period begins.  After \nall, a premature notice is \u201cstill on file\u201d\u2014in other \nwords, \u201cis filed,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a)\u2014when the \nappeal period begins to run, and it gives \u201cfull notice \n[of the appeal] after that date, as well as before.\u201d  \nLemke, 346 U.S. at 326.   \nAs explained above, courts have long held exactly \nthat with respect to appeal periods governed by \nsubsections (a) and (b).  See supra 22\u201327 (collecting \ncases holding that notices of appeal filed before entry \nof the appealable order ripen when the appeal period \nopens under subsections (a) and (b)).  They have \nreached the same result for appeal periods governed \nby subsection (c)\u2019s first sentence, which addresses \nextensions.  See supra 27.   \n\n \n31 \n \n \nAs every circuit save the Fourth has also \nrecognized, there is no textual basis for treating \nsubsection (c)\u2019s second sentence any differently.  See \nsupra 27 (collecting cases holding that notices of \nappeal filed after the original appeal period expires \nripen when the appeal period is reopened).  Each \nsubsection of \u00a7 2107 uses different language to set \ndifferent deadlines.  But the same language in \nsubsection \n(a) \ncreates \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement for all three subsections.  That \nrequirement must work the same way across the \nentire statute.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (where one statutory term \u201capplies without \ndifferentiation to\u201d a set of \u201ccategories,\u201d construing it \nto perform different work as to \u201ceach category \nwould . . . invent a statute,\u201d not \u201cinterpret one\u201d).   \nHistory. Historical context points in the same \ndirection.  Subsection (c) was added to \u00a7 2107 in 1991, \nwhen Congress acted on a suggestion in the Advisory \nCommittee\u2019s Notes on Rule 4.  Pub. L. 102-198, \u00a7 12 \n(Dec. 9, 1991) (\u201cConformity with Rules of Appellate \nProcedure\u201d); see Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. Notes \n(1991) (\u201crecommend[ing],\u201d in a \u201cTransmittal Note,\u201d \nthat \u00a7 2107 \u201cmight appropriately be revised in light of \nth[e] proposed [Rule 4(a)(6)]\u201d).  By that point, as this \nCourt had recognized just a few months earlier, there \nwas a well-established \u201cgeneral practice in the courts \nof appeals of deeming certain premature notices of \nappeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; see supra \n22\u201326.  The functional approach to notices of appeal \nwas also long settled.  See supra 20\u201322.  Against that \nbackdrop, \nthe \ndrafters \nof \nthe \nFederal \nRules \nunderstood that premature notices of appeal would \n\n \n32 \n \n \nripen when an appeal period opened absent an \nexpress provision to the contrary.  See supra 25.   \nCongress would have understood that too.  And \nwhen it added \u00a7 2107(c) to expand access to appellate \nreview, it said nothing to prevent the background \nripening principle from operating on \u00a7 2107(c) the \nsame way it does on the statute\u2019s first two subsections.  \nCf. Arellano v. McDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 6 (2023) \n(equitable \ntolling \nforms \nthe \n\u201cjurisprudential \nbackdrop\u201d for interpreting limitations periods); Peter \nv. NantKwest, Inc., 589 U.S. 23, 30 (2019) (recognizing \nthat the background American Rule is \u201cthe starting \npoint\u201d for assessing a fee-shifting statute); Lorillard v. \nPons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) (explaining that \nCongress \nis \n\u201cpresumed \nto \nbe \naware \nof \nan \nadministrative or judicial interpretation of a statute \nand to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a \nstatute without change\u201d); Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. \nT.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239 (2009) (similar); Boeing Co. v. \nUnited States, 537 U.S. 437, 457 (2003) (similar).   \nIn fact, Congress did the opposite:  It used language \nthat perfectly encapsulates the \u201cno prejudice\u201d \nrationale that has animated the ripening principle \nsince its inception.  Compare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2) \n(authorizing reopening only upon a finding that \u201cno \nparty would be prejudiced\u201d), with FirsTier, 498 U.S. at \n273 (recognizing that \u201cprematurity . . . should not be \nallowed to extinguish an otherwise proper appeal\u201d \nwhere the \u201cpremature notice[ ] do[es] not prejudice \nthe appellee\u201d); see also, e.g., Firchau, 345 F.2d at 271 \n(notice sufficient when \u201cpremature filing\u201d did not \n\u201caffect[] substantial rights\u201d); Markham, 369 F.2d at \n942 (standard for ripening is whether \u201cprejudice will \nresult to the appellee\u201d); Song Jook Suh, 437 F.2d \n\n \n33 \n \n \nat 1100 (premature notice sufficient where no one was \nprejudiced); Eason, 390 F.2d at 588 (\u201cthe test [for \nripening] was one of prejudice or its absence\u201d); Morris, \n442 F.2d at 1250 (permitting ripening when \u201cno \nprejudice could result to any one\u201d); Hodge, 507 F.2d at \n89 (permitting ripening when \u201cthe non-appealing \nparty is not prejudiced by the prematurity\u201d); In re \nGrand Jury, 541 F.2d at 376\u201377 (permitting ripening \nbecause \u201cthe government ha[d] not been prejudiced by \nthe prematurity\u201d); Richerson, 551 F.2d at 922\u201323 \n(permitting ripening \u201cin the absence of a showing of \nprejudice to the other party\u201d); Tilden Fin. Corp., 596 \nF.2d at 606\u201307 (permitting ripening absent risk of \n\u201cprejudice to either party\u201d); Williams v. Okoboji, 599 \nF.2d 238, 239 (8th Cir. 1979) (\u201cgenerally the appellant \nmay proceed\u201d despite a \u201cprematurely filed notice of \nappeal,\u201d \nabsent \n\u201cprejudice \nresulting \nfrom \nthe \nprematurity of the notice\u201d).  \nBecause \u00a7 2107(c) incorporates the \u201cno prejudice\u201d \nstandard, ripening is always warranted upon \nreopening\u2014assuming, of course, that a notice of \nappeal is otherwise adequate.  Notices filed after \nexpiration of the ordinary appeal period but before \nreopening are necessarily filed after judgment.  So \nthey \u201cprovide[ ] sufficient notice to other parties and \nthe courts\u201d of the grounds for the appeal.  Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248; compare Manrique, 581 U.S. at 123\u2013\n25 (premature notice insufficient when filed before \n\u201cthe court has . . . decided the issue that the appellant \nseeks to appeal\u201d), and Sacks v. Rothberg, 845 F.2d \n1098, 1099 & n.* (D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam) \n(observing that every circuit recognizes this limitation \nin civil cases, too), with Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7) \n(providing that \u201cfailure to properly designate the \n\n \n34 \n \n \njudgment\u201d is not grounds for dismissal \u201cif the notice of \nappeal was filed after entry\u201d).  Indeed, they \nnecessarily provide appellees and courts with more \nnotice than post-reopening notices, not less.  See \nLemke, 346 U.S. at 326 (recognizing that premature \nnotices of appeal give \u201cfull notice after\u201d the appeal \nperiod begins, \u201cas well as before\u201d); Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdv. Comm. Notes to 1993 Amendment (observing \nthat an appellee would receive \u201csufficient notice of the \nappellant\u2019s intentions\u201d from a premature notice).  \nSection 2107(c) thus fits comfortably within the \nripening tradition against which it was enacted. \nC. Ripening upon reopening is a simple \njurisdictional \nrule \nthat \npreserves \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s purpose. \nApplying ordinary ripening principles results in a \nstraightforward jurisdictional rule that benefits \nparties and courts alike.  It also avoids undermining \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s purpose, which was to preserve appellate \nrights for litigants who fail to receive timely notice of \na judgment through no fault of their own.  The Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsecond-notice \nrequirement \nguts \nthe \nreopening mechanism by rendering it ineffective for \nmany of the people who need it most. \n1. Jurisdictional rules \u201chave a unique potential to \ndisrupt the orderly course of litigation.\u201d  Wilkins, 598 \nU.S. at 157.  They have \u201cdrastic\u201d consequences, \ndepriving courts of the power to resolve disputes no \nmatter the equities.  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. \n428, 435 (2011).  And they force courts to issue-spot \nwithout party assistance\u2014and even sometimes (as \nhere) against party agreement.  See id. at 434 \n(\u201c[F]ederal courts have an independent obligation to \n\n \n35 \n \n \nensure that they do not exceed the scope of their \njurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide \njurisdictional questions that the parties either \noverlook or elect not to press.\u201d).  For these reasons, \n\u201csimplicity is a major virtue\u201d for jurisdictional rules.  \nHertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010).   \nThis \nCourt \nhas \nlong \nendorsed \na \nsimple \njurisdictional rule for notices of appeal:  If a notice is \nfunctionally sufficient\u2014i.e., if it actually provides \nadequate notice before the jurisdictional deadline\u2014it \ndoes the trick.  See supra 20\u201322.  That simple rule has \na simple corollary:  Notices of appeal filed after the \nordinary appeal period expires ripen when reopening \nis granted.  That is a straightforward, intuitive rule \nthat can readily be applied in every case.  It also \navoids creating a second-notice tripwire that litigants \nmust spot\u2014or else pay the jurisdictional price.   \n2. Reading \u00a7 2107(c) to set that trap would make the \nreopening mechanism virtually useless for the very \npeople it serves: pro se litigants in general, and \nincarcerated pro se litigants in particular.   \nBecause reopening is available only for litigants \nwho do not receive notice of an adverse ruling within \n21 days, pro se litigants are its almost-exclusive \nbeneficiaries.  The reason for that is straightforward:  \nWhereas lawyers now almost always receive instant \nelectronic notice, pro se litigants usually must grapple \nwith old-fashioned mail.  Compare Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 5(d)(3)(a) (\u201cA person represented by an attorney \nmust file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is \nallowed by the court for good cause or required by local \nrule.\u201d), with Federal Judicial Center, Federal Courts\u2019 \nElectronic Filing by Pro Se Litigants 1, 3, 7\u20138 (2022), \n\n \n36 \n \n \nhttps://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/materials/20/\nFederalCourtProSeECF.pdf (finding that only around \nhalf of federal district courts permit pro se litigants to \nfile electronically and that \u201c[p]risoners cannot use \nCM/ECF\u201d even in those jurisdictions).  And despite \nthe postal service\u2019s best efforts, \u201csnow [or] rain [or] \nheat [or] gloom of night\u201d can sometimes \u201cstay[]\u201d even \nthe finest \u201ccourier from swift completion of their \nappointed rounds.\u201d  U.S. Postal Service, Postal Service \nMission and \u201cMotto,\u201d https://about.usps.com/who/\nprofile/history/pdf/mission-motto.pdf; see U.S. Postal \nService, Analysis of FY 2023 Performance 31 (2024), \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/\n2803_2804%20Report_Final.pdf (finding that \u201cthe \nPostal Service failed to meet six out of its eight targets \nfor\u201d first-class mail products \u201c[i]n FY 2023,\u201d including \nlate delivery of nearly 20 percent of mail meant to be \ndelivered within three to five days); U.S. Postal \nService Office of Inspector General, Spring 2024 \nSemiannual \nReport \nto \nCongress \n16 \n(2024), \nhttps://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/\n2024-05/FY2024_Spring_SARC.pdf \n(reporting \nproblems with timely mail delivery in 95% of audited \nlocations).     \nIncarcerated pro se litigants face further obstacles \nto timely notice.

Incarcerated people are \nmoved frequently and for a variety of reasons.  See \nU.S. Marshals Service, JPATS: A Day in the Life of \nPrisoner Transports (Aug. 23, 2024) (U.S. Marshals \nperform \u201cover 200,000 prisoner movements yearly,\u201d \nincluding for \u201cdisciplinary reasons, court and study \n\n \n38 \n \n \norders, mental health evaluations, and attorney \nspecial requests\u201d), https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/\nstories/jpats-day-life-of-prisoner-transports; see also, \ne.g., Cir.App.150\u201351 (documenting at least 18 such \nmoves across 12 years).

The resulting delays can be \nsubstantial.  See, e.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 667 (order \n\u201ctook months to reach\u201d the appellant because he had \nbeen moved to a different prison); Reho v.

And it worked.  Thanks to \u00a7 2107(c), mail \ndelays and prison-processing problems no longer \ndeprive pro se litigants of their right to appeal.  See \nPet.App.67a\u201368a (Gregory, J., dissenting from denial \nof rehearing en banc) (reopening is \u201cmost commonly, \nif not exclusively, sought by pro se litigants who were \nunable to notice their [appeal on time], often due to no \nfault of their own\u201d); 16A Fed.

(reopening allays \u201cthe plight of th[e] litigant\u201d \nwho \u201cfirst learned of the entry of judgment\u201d too late to \nseek an extension of the appeal period).   \n3. At least, they didn\u2019t until the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nsecond-notice requirement came along.  That new \nmandate sets a \u201ctrap for the unwary,\u201d penalizing the \nsame litigants \u00a7 2107(c) was designed to serve.  \nAverhart, 773 F.2d at 920.  And even the most wary \nmay be unable to avoid its harsh effects. \nThe problem for the unwary is obvious.  \u201cThe idea \nthat the first notice of appeal lapses . . . is not \nintuitive.\u201d  Id.  And experience has proven that \n\u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se litigants, fail to file \n[a] second notice of appeal\u201d even in the face of clear \nrules requiring one.  Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1993); see also Blanchard v. Frosh, 2024 WL \n4471726 (4th Cir. Oct. 11, 2024) (per curiam) \n(dismissing appeal for failure to file post-reopening \nnotice, despite clear requirement to do so articulated \nin the decision below).  Indeed, even attorneys may \nnot realize that a duplicative notice is required.  Cf. \nLewis v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 850 F.2d 641, 645 (10th \nCir. 1988) (en banc) (explaining that the court\u2019s earlier \npractice of requiring a duplicative notice after Rule \n54(b) certification had \u201coften proved a trap for unwary \nattorneys\u201d).   \n\n \n40 \n \n \nThe short length of the reopening window makes \nthat bad problem worse.  The same mail and prison-\nprocessing delays that warrant reopening in the first \nplace will eat up at least some of the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  See supra 35\u201338; see, e.g., Appellant\u2019s Motion \nfor Extension of Time to Respond at 1, Holston v. \nMora, No. 22-12808 (Feb. 6, 2025) (requesting \nadditional time because pro se appellant did not \nreceive court\u2019s request for briefing until the 13th day \nof 14-day briefing period).  And incarcerated litigants \ncan\u2019t just jump onto Westlaw any time they please.  \nSee 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 543.11(i) (directing that \u201ceach inmate \nshall continue his regular institutional activities \nwithout undue disruption by legal activities\u201d); Ohio \nAdmin. Code R. 5120-9-20(B)(3) (\u201cEach institution \nshall establish a schedule of library hours when legal \nmaterials can be used.\u201d); cf. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. \n343, 351 (1996) (no \u201cfreestanding right to a law \nlibrary\u201d).  So it is anything but reasonable to expect \nthat litigants who receive a reopening order will be \nable to discover the second-notice requirement\u2014and \nget a second notice on file\u2014before the reopening \nwindow closes. \nIndeed, for many of those litigants, the reopening \nclock will run before they even learn that reopening \nhas been granted\u2014making compliance with the \nsecond-notice requirement quite literally impossible.  \nBy definition, every litigant who benefits from \nreopening did not receive notice of an adverse \njudgment within 21 days.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nThe problem should be as obvious as the fact that 14 \nis less than 21:  The same litigants who do not learn \nof an adverse judgment within 21 days may not learn \nof a reopening order within 14 days.  Except this time, \n\n \n41 \n \n \nthere is no further reopening mechanism\u2014or even \nequitable remedy\u2014to save them.  Under Bowles v. \nRussell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), a court can grant \nreopening just once, for just 14 days.  Id. at 213 \n(holding that \u201cCongress specifically limited the \namount of time by which district courts can extend the \nnotice-of-appeal period in \u00a7 2107(c)\u201d).  And once that \n14-day period expires, courts have \u201cno authority to \ncreate equitable exceptions.\u201d  Id.  The upshot is that, \nunder the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule, litigants who do not \nlearn of a reopening order within 14 days lose the \nright to appeal altogether. \nWhat reason could there be for that result?  Again, \n\u00a7 2107(c) authorizes reopening only upon a finding \nthat \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c)(2); see supra 10, 32\u201333.  So requiring \nlitigants to file a second notice of appeal would be \nnothing more than a \u201chollow ritual\u201d of \u201cempty paper \nshuffling\u201d that benefits no one.  N. Am. Specialty, 527 \nF.3d at 1039 (citation omitted).  And the litigants it \npenalizes\u2014people who systematically fail to receive \ntimely notice of court orders\u2014are the very same ones \n\u00a7 2107(c) was designed to protect.   \nIf a statute \u201cis susceptible of two constructions, one \nof which will carry out and the other defeat its \nmanifest object, [it] should receive the former \nconstruction.\u201d  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, \nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 63\u201365 \n(2012) (cleaned up); see also Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 181 (2014) (rejecting reading \nthat would \u201cdefeat the point\u201d of the statute).  That \ncanon could have been written for this case.  This \nCourt has previously rejected constructions of notice-\nof-appeal rules that \u201cplace[ ] pro se litigants in a \n\n \n42 \n \n \nsingularly exacting time bind.\u201d  Becker, 532 U.S. at \n766.  It should do so again here. \nII. THE \nFOURTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nSECOND-NOTICE \nREQUIREMENT \nLACKS \nANY \nSOUND \nJUSTIFICATION. \nThe Fourth Circuit rejected Parrish\u2019s notice of \nappeal for two reasons.  First, it concluded that \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s use of the word \u201creopen\u201d\u2014particularly in \nconjunction with the word \u201cextend\u201d\u2014implicitly \nprecludes notices of appeal from ripening when \nreopening is granted.  Second, it suggested that \nnotices of appeal cease to operate as notices of appeal \nonce they are construed as motions to reopen.  Neither \npoint withstands scrutiny.   \nA.  \u201cReopen\u201d is consistent with ripening. \nNothing about the word \u201creopen\u201d\u2014either on its own \nor in conjunction with the word \u201cextend\u201d\u2014displaces \nthe background ripening principle.  Yes, \u201creopening\u201d \nis often (though not always) granted after the original \nappeal period closes.  But contrary to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s assumption, the ripening principle has never \nhinged on the fiction that the appeal period was \nactually open all along.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nattempt to distinguish \u201creopenings\u201d from \u201cextensions\u201d \non that basis fails, because extensions do not \nnecessarily create a continuous appeal period, either.  \n1. As Parrish\u2019s own case reflects, appeal periods can \n\u201creopen\u201d after having been closed.  See Pet.App.57a \n(recognizing that the ordinary appeal period expired \n60 days after the District Court entered its judgment \non March 24, 2020 (citing Rule 4(a)(1)(B))); Pet.App.5a \n(recognizing that the appeal period was reopened on \nJanuary 8, 2021).  But a prior closure is by no means \n\n \n43 \n \n \nrequired.  Reopening is available when an appellant \ndoes not receive notice within 21 days\u2014which is less \nthan the ordinary time allowed for appeals under \neither \u00a7 2107(a) or \u00a7 2107(b).  That means reopening \ncan be granted either before or after the original \nappeal period expires.   \nBut even assuming, as the Fourth Circuit seemed \nto, that the word \u201creopen\u201d necessarily implies a prior \nclosure, see Pet.App.10a, that in no way precludes \nripening.  Quite the opposite:  Ripening only ever \ncomes into play when a notice of appeal is filed while \nthe appeal period is closed.   \nTake the scenario contemplated by FirsTier and \nRule 4(a)(2), where a notice of appeal is filed after a \ndecision is announced but before an appealable order \nis entered.  See FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2).  No appeal period is open when such a \nnotice is filed.  Nevertheless, the notice ripens when \nthe appeal clock starts ticking.  That is because \u201cthe \ntechnical defect of prematurity\u201d does not \u201cextinguish \n[the] otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at \n273.  It is not because entry of an appealable order \nsomehow rewrites history and retroactively extends \nthe appeal period all the way back to when the notice \nwas first filed.  The appeal clock still started when it \nstarted.  See, e.g., Firchau, 345 F.2d at 271 \n(acknowledging \u201cthe premature filing of th[e] notice\u201d \nbefore entry of final judgment).  \nRule 54(b) certification works the same way.  See \nsupra 26\u201327 (citing cases and noting that courts of \nappeals unanimously recognize ripening in this \ncontext).  A notice of appeal filed before certification \nof an interlocutory order is not filed during any open \n\n \n44 \n \n \nappeal \nperiod. \n \nNevertheless, \na \nsubsequent \ncertification ripens the previously filed notice.  See, \ne.g., Swope, 281 F.3d at 191\u201394.  The notice, in other \nwords, becomes effective once the appeal period opens.  \nNo one pretends that the appeal period actually \nstretched back to the original, uncertified order.  See, \ne.g., Tilden, 596 F.2d at 607 (acknowledging that \u201cthe \nappeal was taken prematurely\u201d before entry of Rule \n54(b) certification).   \nIn these contexts and others, ripening is required \nprecisely because the appeal window was closed when \nthe notice of appeal was filed.  In none of them does \nripening turn on a time traveler\u2019s fiction that the \nwindow was actually open all along.  So even \nassuming the word \u201creopen\u201d implied a prior closure, \nthe ripening principle still applies.  Indeed, the fact \nthat the appeal period was closed when the notice of \nappeal was filed is what sets the stage for the ripening \nin the first place.  \n2. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \n\u201creopening\u201d an appeal period from \u201cextending\u201d it goes \nnowhere for similar reasons.  The two mechanisms\u2019 \nobvious differences account for their different labels.  \nThere is no way to read those labels as implicitly \nincorporating the ripening principle in \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first \nsentence but displacing it in the second\u2014including \nbecause the Fourth Circuit\u2019s assumption that \nextensions always result in a continuous appeal \nperiod was simply mistaken.   \na. Section 2107(c)\u2019s two sentences create two \ndifferent mechanisms that address two different sets \nof circumstances.  They have different standards:  \nExtensions are warranted \u201cupon a showing of \n\n \n45 \n \n \nexcusable neglect or good cause,\u201d while reopening is \nwarranted when the appellant did not receive notice \nof a judgment \u201cwithin 21 days.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nThey have different deadlines:  Extension motions \nmust be \u201cfiled not later than 30 days after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal,\u201d while reopening motions must be \u201cfiled \nwithin 180 days after entry of the judgment or order \nor within 14 days after receipt of such notice, \nwhichever is earlier.\u201d  Id.  And they authorize \ndifferent relief:  Congress did not impose an outside \nlimit on extensions, see Hamer, 583 U.S. at 24\u201327 \n(holding that \u201cthe statute does not say how long an \nextension may run\u201d and that the 30-day limit in Rule \n4(a)(5)(C) is only a claim-processing rule), while \nreopening is limited to 14 days, see Bowles, 551 U.S. \nat 213 (holding that the 14-day limit is jurisdictional).  \nThese obvious, structural differences between the \ntwo mechanisms more than account for their different \nnames.  Indeed, it would have been strange for \nCongress to have used the same label for both of them.  \n\u201cMotion to reopen\u201d is much clearer\u2014and much \nsimpler\u2014than \u201cmotion to extend the appeal period \nunder \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.\u201d \nTo be sure, the two mechanisms\u2014which appear in \nthe same subsection\u2014also have plenty in common:  \nBoth provide additional time for an appeal; both \nrequire a motion; both afford district courts discretion; \nand both, as explained above (as to reopening) and \nbelow (as to extension), are available before or after \nthe original appeal period expires.  See supra 42\u201343 \n(explaining that reopening is also available before \noriginal appeal period expires); see infra 46\u201348 \n(explaining that extensions are also available after \n\n \n46 \n \n \noriginal \nperiod \nexpires). \n \nAdding \none \nmore \ncommonality to that list\u2014that both incorporate the \nbackground ripening principle\u2014is entirely consistent \nwith the material-variation canon.  That canon \nrecognizes that different terms generally differ along \nat least one axis; it does not require construing \ndifferent terms to be different in every respect.  Cf. \nCity of Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Serv., \nInc., 536 U.S. 424, 435 (2002) (different parts of \nstatute had the same scope \u201cnotwithstanding th[e] \ndifference in verbal formulation\u201d). \nb. In concluding otherwise, the Fourth Circuit \ndoubled down on its fictional-continuity idea, \nsuggesting that the word \u201cextension\u201d implicitly \nincorporates the ripening principle because an \nextension necessarily entails a continuous appeal \nperiod.  Pet.App.9a\u201312a.  As already explained, the \npremise of that argument is wrong:  Ripening does not \nrequire continuity.  See supra Part II.A.1.   \nThe court\u2019s understanding of how extensions work \nwas wrong, too.  The Federal Rules provide that a \ncourt can \u201cextend the time\u201d for complying with a civil \ndeadline not only \u201cbefore the original time . . . expires\u201d \nbut also \u201cafter the time has expired.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 6(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  That is entirely consistent with the \nway extensions work in the real world.  They \nsometimes operate as a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of some \nongoing period.  HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 390.  But \nit is also \u201centirely natural\u2014and consistent with \nordinary usage\u2014to seek an \u2018extension\u2019 of time even \nafter some lapse.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThink of the forgetful student \nwho asks for an \u2018extension\u2019 for a term paper after the \ndeadline has passed, the tenant who does the same \nafter overstaying his lease, or parties who negotiate \n\n \n47 \n \n \nan \u2018extension\u2019 of a contract after its expiration.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, this Court has previously failed to identify \u201ca \nsingle dictionary definition of the term \u2018extension\u2019 \nrequiring unbroken continuity.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Black\u2019s \nLaw Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (defining \u201cextension\u201d \nas \u201c[a] period of additional time to take an action\u201d).  \nSection 2107(c) extensions are no different.  A \nmotion to extend the appeal period can be filed either \nbefore or after the original appeal deadline expires.  \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (authorizing extensions \u201cupon \nmotion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration \nof the time otherwise set for bringing appeal\u201d); see also \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A) (\u201cThe district court may \nextend the time to file a notice of appeal if . . . a party \nso moves no later than 30 days after the time \nprescribed . . . .\u201d). \nThat does not mean that an extension\u2014in this \ncontext, or any other\u2014retroactively extends the \noriginal time allotted all the way through to the new \ndeadline.  This Court recognized exactly that in \nHollyFrontier.  HollyFrontier held that refineries may \nreceive a benefit in Year 1, not receive that benefit in \nYear 2, and then receive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same \nbenefit in Year 3.  594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, \nthe Court rejected the notion that extensions \n\u201coperate[ ] like . . . nunc pro tunc judicial decree[s]\u2014\nretroactively deeming the time originally allotted as \nnow extending continuously to some new and future \ndue date.\u201d  Id. at 392.  An extension may excuse an \notherwise timely filing; but \u201c[i]t cannot change the \nfact that, absent time travel, a lapse or interruption \nhas occurred.\u201d  Id.  \n\n \n48 \n \n \nThe Court even used \u00a7 2107(c) as an example.  \n\u201cUnder certain circumstances,\u201d the Court recognized, \n\u201ca court \u2018may . . . extend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 \neven \u2018after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c)).  \u201cIn other words, the [appeal clock] can \nstart, run, finish, and then restart\u2014because a court \nhas the power to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after \na lapse.\u201d  Id. at 391.  There is no need to pretend \u201cthat \na break in continuity, a lapse, or an interruption never \nhappened.\u201d  Id. at 392.   \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s vision of extensions is exactly \nthe one HollyFrontier rejected.  As even the Fourth \nCircuit acknowledged, notices filed after an appeal \nperiod lapses ripen when an extension is granted.  See \nPet.App.10a\u201312a; Evans, 366 F.2d at 773.  That is not \nbecause extensions make it so that the appeal period \nnever lapsed at all.  It is because pre-extension notices \nof appeal provide adequate notice to all parties, \nconsistent with ordinary ripening principles.  See \nsupra 20\u201324, 33\u201334.  Pre-reopening notices of appeal \nripen for the same reason.   \nB. A filing can be both a notice of appeal \nand a motion to reopen. \nThe Fourth Circuit also made the offhand \nsuggestion that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal could not be \n\u201creconstrue[d]\u201d as a notice of appeal because it \u201cha[d] \nalready been construed\u2014to his benefit\u2014as a motion \n[to reopen].\u201d  Pet.App.3a\u20134a; see id. at 21a (Gregory, \nJ., dissenting) (characterizing this point as a \n\u201cseparate[ ]\u201d justification for the majority\u2019s ruling).  \nThat suggestion was wrong, as a matter of both \nprecedent and principle.   \n\n \n49 \n \n \n1. In Smith, this Court held that an appellate brief \ncould also be construed as a notice of appeal.  502 U.S. \nat 249.  The \u201cFederal Rules,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201cdo \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings.\u201d  Id.  But they \u201cdo \nnot preclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  Id.  A notice of \nappeal, in other words, need not be filed on a separate \npiece of paper that serves no other purpose.  See id.  \n\u201cIf a document filed within the time specified by Rule \n4\u201d affords the requisite notice, \u201cit is effective as a \nnotice of appeal\u201d\u2014regardless of how that document is \nlabeled or what other roles it performs.  Id. at 248\u201349; \nsee supra 20\u201322 (discussing the functional approach \nto notices of appeal). \nThat principle is not limited to appellate briefs.  \nRequests \nfor \ncertificates \nof \nappealability \ncan \nmoonlight as notices of appeal.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 22(b)(2) (\u201cIf no express request for a certificate [of \nappealability] is filed, the notice of appeal constitutes \na request addressed to the judges of the court of \nappeals.\u201d); see, e.g., Clark v. Cartledge, 829 F.3d 303, \n307 n.3 (4th Cir. 2016) (construing a motion for \nextension of time to request a certificate of \nappealability as both a notice of appeal and a request \nfor a certificate of appealability).  Motions to proceed \nin forma pauperis can, too.  See, e.g., Taylor v. Knapp, \n871 F.2d 803, 805 n.1 (9th Cir. 1989) (\u201cThe district \ncourt properly treated Taylor\u2019s motion to proceed on \nappeal in forma pauperis as a notice of appeal[.]\u201d).  \nEven affidavits can suffice.  See, e.g., United States v. \nGibson, 568 F.2d 111, 112 (8th Cir. 1978) (per curiam) \n(construing affidavit accompanying a motion for leave \n\n \n50 \n \n \nto appeal in forma pauperis as a notice of appeal).  In \neach of these contexts, Smith\u2019s reasoning controls.   \nMotions to reopen are no different.  As other courts \nof appeals have recognized, Smith compels the \nconclusion that a single filing can be both a motion to \nreopen and a notice of appeal.  See, e.g., Winters, 88 \nF.4th at 669\u201371 (citing Smith, recognizing that a \nfiling \u201cmay serve more than one function,\u201d and \nconstruing a notice of appeal as a motion to reopen); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 386\u201387 (7th Cir. 2020) \n(citing Smith and rejecting the argument that a \nmotion to reopen \u201ccannot [also] be construed as a \nnotice of appeal\u201d); see also Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062 \n(\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d).   \n2. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s suggestion that Parrish\u2019s \nnotice of appeal ceased operating as a notice of appeal \nonce it was construed as a motion to reopen also flouts \nbasic principles of appellate jurisdiction and civil \nlitigation. \nFor starters, jurisdictional rules come only from \nstatutes.  Hamer, 583 U.S. at 19.  No statute imposes \na separate-document requirement for notices of \nappeal.  And the Federal Rules affirmatively provide \nthat \u201c[a]n appeal must not be dismissed for \ninformality of form or title of the notice of appeal.\u201d  \nFed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7). \nWhat the Rules do require is that a notice of appeal \nleave \u201cno genuine doubt . . . about who is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, [and] to which appellate court.\u201d  \nBecker, 532 U.S. at 767; see also Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7).  \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal fits that bill.  It specifies the \n\n \n51 \n \n \nparty taking the appeal and the order to be appealed; \nand there was only one court to which the appeal could \nbe taken.  Pet.App.71a; see Fed. R. App. P. 3(c); Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248.  Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal thus did \nexactly what it needed to do:  It put everyone on notice \nof his intent to appeal.   \nParrish was also acting pro se.  Courts have a duty \nto construe pro se filings generously.  See supra 22; \nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94; Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106; \nHaines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972) (per \ncuriam).  That sometimes means they must \u201cignore \nthe legal label that a pro se litigant attaches to a \nmotion and recharacterize the motion in order to place \nit within a different legal category.\u201d  Castro v. United \nStates, 540 U.S. 375, 381 (2003).  That sort of \nrecharacterization \u201cavoid[s] inappropriately stringent \napplication of formal labeling requirements\u201d and \nensures \u201ccorrespondence between the substance of a \npro se motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis.\u201d  \nId. at 381\u201382; see also Mata v. Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, \n150\u201351 (2015) (recognizing that \u201ccourts sometimes \nconstrue one kind of filing as another\u201d).   \nThe Fourth Circuit abided these principles when it \nconstrued Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion to \nreopen.  Its refusal to also construe his notice of appeal \nas a notice of appeal is exactly the sort of \n\u201cinappropriately stringent application of formal \nlabeling requirements\u201d this Court has consistently \nrejected.  Castro, 540 U.S. at 381. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the decision below and \nremand for the Fourth Circuit to consider Parrish\u2019s \nappeal on the merits. \n \n\n \n52 \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nAmanda R.

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet.

App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of appeal is best viewed as \n\u201cpremature\u201d to the reopened period, and \u201cthe technical \n\n12 \n \ndefect of prematurity  * * *  should not be allowed to \nextinguish an otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier \nMortg., 498 U.S. at 273; cf. Pet. App. 16a-18a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting) (drawing additional support from cir-\ncuit precedent giving effect to untimely notices of ap-\npeal filed before the time for appeal is extended under \nRule 4(a)(5)). \n2. Although the decision below is incorrect, peti-\ntioner fails to identify any compelling basis for further \nreview, particularly while the Advisory Committee is \nstudying the issue and has the authority to amend the \nrules in a manner that could obviate any need for addi-\ntional guidance from this Court.  See pp. 16-17, infra. \nPetitioner principally contends (Pet. 15-22) that the \ndecision below implicates a division of authority within \nthe courts of appeals, but petitioner overstates the de-\ngree of any such conflict.  District courts have had the \nauthority to reopen the time for appeal under Section \n2107(c) since 1991.  See Pub. L. No. 102-198, \u00a7 12, 105 \nStat. 1627; see also Fed. R. App. 4 advisory committee\u2019s \nnote (1991 Amendment).  But petitioner identifies (Pet. \n17-18) only one other published decision in which a court \nof appeals squarely addressed the jurisdictional ques-\ntion that petitioner seeks to present here.  See Winters \nv. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.) (concluding that a litigant who filed an untimely \nnotice of appeal and then successfully moved for reo-\npening of the appeal period \u201cdid not need to file a new \nnotice of appeal after the district court granted [his] \nmotion to reopen,\u201d under the principle that \u201c[a] notice \nof appeal filed too early, generally speaking, ripens \nwhen the window to appeal begins\u201d) (citing, inter alia, \nFirsTier Mortg., 498 U.S. at 273). \n\n13 \n \nPetitioner also relies (Pet. 18) on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in United States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055 \n(2011), but that case did not expressly resolve the same \njurisdictional issue.  The Ninth Circuit instead per-\nceived the key jurisdictional issue to be whether a pro \nse litigant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal should have been \n\u201cconstrued  * * *  as a motion to reopen\u201d the appeal pe-\nriod.  Id. at 1061.  After concluding that the district \ncourt should have construed the untimely notice as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted the motion, \nthe court of appeals did not then proceed to address \nwhether the pro se litigant needed to file any further \nnotice of appeal during the reopened period.  Id. at \n1061-1062.  The Ninth Circuit instead appears to have \nassumed that its jurisdiction was proper under those \ncircumstances.  See id. at 1062.  While that result is in-\nconsistent with the result reached by the Fourth Circuit \nhere, the precedential force of Withers remains unclear.  \nThis Court does not afford precedential effect to analo-\ngous \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings.\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citi-\nzens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998).   \nAs petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 19-21), the other \ncircuits to have addressed the same jurisdictional ques-\ntion have done so only in unpublished decisions.  See \nHammer v. Bortz, No. 23-1842, 2024 WL 2559204, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 24, 2024); Holden v. Attorney General of \nN.J., No. 21-1862, 2023 WL 8798084, at *1 n.4 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, No. 21-1027, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1. (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022), cert.  \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 454 (2022); Norwood v. East Allen \nCmty. Schs., 825 Fed. Appx. 383, 386-387 (7th Cir. \n2020); United States v. Marshall, 166 F.3d 349, 1998 \nWL 864012, at *2 (10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998) (Tbl.), cert. \n\n14 \n \ndenied, 528 U.S. 861 (1999).2  Those nonprecedential  \ndecisions would not preclude a future panel from reach-\ning a different conclusion and thus do not necessarily \nshow that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent had it arisen in one of those circuits.  And even \ncounting generously, petitioner has identified fewer \nthan ten opinions on point since reopening motions be-\ncame available in 1991.  The paucity of such decisions \nunderscores that the jurisdictional question does not \narise frequently\u2014and when it does, the courts of ap-\npeals have rarely considered it sufficiently important to \nwarrant a published opinion. \n3. In addition to the absence of any substantial con-\nflict, further review is unwarranted because the ques-\ntion presented lacks practical significance.  The ques-\ntion can arise only through an unlikely combination of \nprocedural missteps.  The district court may reopen the \ntime for appeal only if it first finds that a party entitled \nto receive notice of the entry of a judgment or order \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of the entry \nof the judgment or order.  28 U.S.C 2107(c)(1).  But in \nthe era of electronic filing, most litigants now receive \nimmediate notice of orders and judgments.  Petitioner \nemphasizes (Pet. 23) the possibility that pro se litigants \nmay need to rely on notice via the mail, but \u201c[m]any \ncourts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with \nthe court\u2019s permission,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 5 advisory com-\nmittee\u2019s note (2018 Amendment). \n \n2 Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 21) on Farrow is misplaced for the ad-\nditional reason that the litigant in that case simultaneously filed \nboth a motion to reopen the appeal period and a notice of appeal, \nwhile asking the district court to defer entering the notice until after \ngranting reopening.  See 2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1. \n\n15 \n \nMoreover, even with respect to the presumably small \nnumber of litigants who fail to receive the requisite no-\ntice, the question presented only arises if one of those \nlitigants wishes to appeal, the litigant cannot rely on the \ndistrict court\u2019s separate authority to extend the time for \nappeal, and the litigant makes a timely request that the \nappeal period be reopened\u2014but files a notice of appeal \nonly before the reopening, not after.  Notably, Section \n2107(c) imposes an outer limit of 180 days to request re-\nopening.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (court may act upon a \nmotion filed by the \u201cearlier\u201d of the expiration of 180 \ndays from the entry of the judgment or order at issue \nor 14 days after the moving party receives notice).  If \nthat 180-day period expires before the litigant requests \nreopening, the question presented makes no difference \nbecause the district court lacks authority to reopen the \nappeal period in any event.  And even for a timely re-\nquest, the district court cannot reopen the appeal period \nunless it first finds that \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  \n28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(2).  Petitioner does not demonstrate \nthat such a combination of circumstances is likely to oc-\ncur frequently, and the limited number of appellate deci-\nsions addressing the question presented suggests it does \nnot.  Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own prior court-appointed \ncounsel cited the \u201cthe relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to\u201d as one \nreason for declining to file a petition for rehearing en \nbanc on petitioner\u2019s behalf.  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2. \nPetitioner also overstates (Pet. 22) the practical sig-\nnificance of the decision below within the Fourth Circuit \nitself.  Although the decision below is incorrect, it estab-\nlishes a clear and easily applied jurisdictional rule going \nforward.  District courts in the Fourth Circuit may now \nadvise pro se litigants of the need to file a new notice of \n\n16 \n \nappeal in cases in which a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod is granted.  And although petitioner derides the \nfiling of a second notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod of appeal as a \u201chollow ritual,\u201d Pet. 30 (citation \nomitted), he does not show that filing a second notice \nwill be particularly difficult for most or indeed any liti-\ngants affected by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. \n4. This Court\u2019s review is also unwarranted at the \npresent time because the Advisory Committee has al-\nready taken steps to study whether changes to Rule 4(a) \nmay be warranted.  In Winters, the Sixth Circuit ob-\nserved that the Advisory Committee is \u201ccharge[d]  * * *  \nto review issues of precisely this sort\u201d and has the au-\nthority to \u201cimprov[e] the rules where needed.\u201d  88 F.4th \nat 672.  The Sixth Circuit further observed that the Ad-\nvisory Committee \u201cmay be a profitable next stage for \nthis debate,\u201d ibid.\u2014a sentiment endorsed by the dis-\nsenting judges in this case, see Pet. App. 68a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). \nOn October 9, 2024, after the filing of the petition for \na writ of certiorari in this case, the Advisory Committee \nvoted to form a subcommittee to address the issues \nraised by the Sixth Circuit in Winters and the Fourth \nCircuit in the decision below.  See Memorandum from \nEdward Hartnett to the Advisory Committee on the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, New Suggestion \nfrom Judge Sutton 1-3 (Sept. 5, 2024), reprinted in Ad-\nvisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Tab 7A, at 292-\n295 (Oct. 9, 2024) (reporter\u2019s memorandum describing \nWinters and this case and proposing a subcommittee); \nsee also Jacqueline Thomsen, Administrative Stays \nChanges Weighed After Justices\u2019 Criticism, Bloomberg \nLaw News (Oct. 10, 2024) (noting that the Advisory \nCommittee agreed to \u201clook into the rule on reopening \n\n17 \n \nthe time to file an appeal\u201d in light of Chief Judge Sut-\nton\u2019s suggestion). \nBecause the relevant provisions in Rule 4(a)(6) may \nwell change as a result of the rulemaking process, the \nquestion whether the current language of the rule sup-\nports petitioner may be of limited prospective im-\nportance.  And the Advisory Committee is fully capable \nof addressing the policy concerns that petitioner raises \nhere.  See Pet. 22-27. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \nBRIAN M.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts \ncan reopen an expired appeal period when a party did \nnot receive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts \nof Appeals have divided about whether a notice of \nappeal filed after the expiration of the ordinary appeal \nperiod but before the appeal period is reopened \nbecomes effective once reopening is granted.  \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n\n \nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \nDistrict Court and the appellant in the Court of \nAppeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the District Court and the appellee in the \nCourt of Appeals. \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nSTATEMENT OF RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time \notherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever \nperiod ends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within \nthe time allowed by those rules\u2014the time to \nfile an appeal runs for all parties from the \nentry of the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered.  \n(ii) A party intending to challenge an order \ndisposing of any motion listed in Rule \n4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment\u2019s alteration or \namendment upon such a motion, must file \na notice of appeal, or an amended notice of \nappeal\u2014in compliance with Rule 3(c)\u2014\nwithin the time prescribed by this Rule \nmeasured from the entry of the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion. \n[. . . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an \nAppeal. The district court may reopen the \ntime to file an appeal for a period of 14 days \nafter the date when its order to reopen is \nentered, but only if all the following \nconditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, \nwhichever is earlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n(7) Entry Defined. \n(A) A judgment or order is entered for \npurposes of this Rule 4(a): \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) does not require a separate \ndocument, when the judgment or order \nis entered in the civil docket under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); \nor \n(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) requires a separate document, \nwhen the judgment or order is entered \nin the civil docket under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the \nearlier of these events occurs: \n\u2022 the judgment or order is set forth on \na separate document, or \n\u2022 150 days have run from entry of the \njudgment or order in the civil docket \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n79(a). \n(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or \norder on a separate document when \nrequired \nby \nFederal \nRule \nof \nCivil \nProcedure 58(a) does not affect the \nvalidity of an appeal from that judgment \nor order. \n  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was being transferred \nfrom federal to state custody when the District Court \ndismissed his case.  As a result, he did not receive \nnotice of the judgment against him until well after the \ntime to appeal had expired.  Once he finally learned of \nthe judgment, Parrish filed a notice of appeal that \nexplained his delay.  The Court of Appeals construed \nthat notice as a motion to reopen the appeal period, \nand remanded so the District Court could rule on that \nmotion.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6).  On remand, the District Court found that \nall conditions for reopening were satisfied:  Parrish \nhad not received timely notice of the judgment, he had \npromptly moved for reopening, and no party would be \nprejudiced.  So it granted the motion, reopened the \nappeal period, and returned the case to the Court of \nAppeals. \nParrish had every reason to believe that his appeal \nwould proceed to the merits from there.  And in any \nother court it would have.  As other courts recognize, \npreviously filed notices of appeal \u201cripen\u201d when the \nappeal period reopens.  So the notice of appeal Parrish \nfiled before reopening was granted should have \nsufficed.  But the Fourth Circuit had other ideas.  It \nconcluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was both too \nlate (for the original appeal period) and too early (for \nthe reopened appeal period).  So, according to the \nFourth Circuit, Parrish needed to file a second notice \nof appeal\u2014this time, during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  Since he had not done that, the Fourth Circuit \ndismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThat was wrong.  There was no need for Parrish to \nfile a second notice of appeal, because his original one \nbecame effective when the appeal period reopened.  \nBoth this Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  Consistent with the functional \napproach, this Court has endorsed a \u201cgeneral \npractice\u201d\u2014reflected both in court decisions and the \nFederal Rules\u2014\u201cof deeming certain premature \nnotices of appeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvs. Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nCongress incorporated that background ripening \nprinciple into \u00a7 2107.  And its application to \u00a7 2107(c) \nyields a clear jurisdictional rule that avoids senseless \nresults.  Reopening is available only to litigants who \ndo not receive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(1).  Requiring those litigants to file a \nnotice of appeal within an even shorter, 14-day period \nwould render \u00a7 2107(c) ineffective for many (if not \nmost) of the litigants it serves.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s second-notice requirement has \nno basis in text, precedent, or common sense.  Its only \npurported \ntextual \ngrounding\u2014an \nattempted \ndistinction between \u201creopen\u201d and \u201cextend\u201d\u2014is both \nnonsensical and irreconcilable with HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 \nU.S. 382 (2021).  The court\u2019s alternative suggestion \nthat motions to reopen cannot also function as notices \nof app\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  A petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on September 9, 2024, and this Court \ngranted certiorari on January 17, 2025.  This Court \nhas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n\u00a7 2107. Time for appeal to court of appeals \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or \nproceeding of a civil nature before a court of \nappeals for review unless notice of appeal is \nfiled, within thirty days after the entry of \nsuch judgment, order or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause.  In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after entry of the judgment \nor order or within 14 days after receipt of \nsuch notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the \ntime for appeal for a period of 14 days from \nthe date of entry of the order reopening the \ntime for appeal. \n[. . . .] \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules \n4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of \nappeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with \nthe district clerk within 30 days after entry of \nthe judgment or order appealed from. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee sued in an individual \ncapacity [in certain circumstances] . . . . \n[. . . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a \ndecision or order\u2014but before the entry of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \njudgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time \notherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever \nperiod ends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within \nthe time allowed by those rules\u2014the time to \nfile an appeal runs for all parties from the \nentry of the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered.  \n(ii) A party intending to challenge an order \ndisposing of any motion listed in Rule \n4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment\u2019s alteration or \namendment upon such a motion, must file \na notice of appeal, or an amended notice of \nappeal\u2014in compliance with Rule 3(c)\u2014\nwithin the time prescribed by this Rule \nmeasured from the entry of the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion. \n[. . . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an \nAppeal. The district court may reopen the \ntime to file an appeal for a period of 14 days \nafter the date when its order to reopen is \nentered, but only if all the following \nconditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, \nwhichever is earlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n(7) Entry Defined. \n(A) A judgment or order is entered for \npurposes of this Rule 4(a): \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) does not require a separate \ndocument, when the judgment or order \nis entered in the civil docket under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); \nor \n(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58(a) requires a separate document, \nwhen the judgment or order is entered \nin the civil docket under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the \nearlier of these events occurs: \n\u2022 the judgment or order is set forth on \na separate document, or \n\u2022 150 days have run from entry of the \njudgment or order in the civil docket \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n79(a). \n(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or \norder on a separate document when \nrequired \nby \nFederal \nRule \nof \nCivil \nProcedure 58(a) does not affect the \nvalidity of an appeal from that judgment \nor order. \n  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was being transferred \nfrom federal to state custody when the District Court \ndismissed his case.  As a result, he did not receive \nnotice of the judgment against him until well after the \ntime to appeal had expired.  Once he finally learned of \nthe judgment, Parrish filed a notice of appeal that \nexplained his delay.  The Court of Appeals construed \nthat notice as a motion to reopen the appeal period, \nand remanded so the District Court could rule on that \nmotion.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6).  On remand, the District Court found that \nall conditions for reopening were satisfied:  Parrish \nhad not received timely notice of the judgment, he had \npromptly moved for reopening, and no party would be \nprejudiced.  So it granted the motion, reopened the \nappeal period, and returned the case to the Court of \nAppeals. \nParrish had every reason to believe that his appeal \nwould proceed to the merits from there.  And in any \nother court it would have.  As other courts recognize, \npreviously filed notices of appeal \u201cripen\u201d when the \nappeal period reopens.  So the notice of appeal Parrish \nfiled before reopening was granted should have \nsufficed.  But the Fourth Circuit had other ideas.  It \nconcluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was both too \nlate (for the original appeal period) and too early (for \nthe reopened appeal period).  So, according to the \nFourth Circuit, Parrish needed to file a second notice \nof appeal\u2014this time, during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  Since he had not done that, the Fourth Circuit \ndismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThat was wrong.  There was no need for Parrish to \nfile a second notice of appeal, because his original one \nbecame effective when the appeal period reopened.  \nBoth this Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  Consistent with the functional \napproach, this Court has endorsed a \u201cgeneral \npractice\u201d\u2014reflected both in court decisions and the \nFederal Rules\u2014\u201cof deeming certain premature \nnotices of appeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvs. Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nCongress incorporated that background ripening \nprinciple into \u00a7 2107.  And its application to \u00a7 2107(c) \nyields a clear jurisdictional rule that avoids senseless \nresults.  Reopening is available only to litigants who \ndo not receive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(1).  Requiring those litigants to file a \nnotice of appeal within an even shorter, 14-day period \nwould render \u00a7 2107(c) ineffective for many (if not \nmost) of the litigants it serves.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s second-notice requirement has \nno basis in text, precedent, or common sense.  Its only \npurported \ntextual \ngrounding\u2014an \nattempted \ndistinction between \u201creopen\u201d and \u201cextend\u201d\u2014is both \nnonsensical and irreconcilable with HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 \nU.S. 382 (2021).  The court\u2019s alternative suggestion \nthat motions to reopen cannot also function as notices \nof appeal is foreclosed by Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244 \n(1992).   \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal ripened when the appeal \nperiod reopened.  No second notice was required.  This \nCourt should reverse the decision below and remand \nfor a ruling on the merits. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 governs the \u201ctime for appeal\u201d in \ncivil cases.  Subsection (a) requires appellants to file \nnotices of appeal \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof\u201d the \u201cjudgment, order or decree\u201d they seek to \nchallenge.  Subsection (b) provides a longer \u201ctime\u201d\u2014\n\u201c60 days from such entry\u201d\u2014if the parties include the \nUnited States, a federal agency, or certain federal \nofficers.  Subsection (c) provides that those default \nappeal periods can be extended or reopened based on \nextenuating circumstances.  \nSection 2107(c) consists of two sentences.  The first \nsentence provides that district courts may \u201cextend the \ntime for appeal\u201d \u201cupon motion filed not later than 30 \ndays after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2107(c).  That relief is \navailable upon \u201ca showing of excusable neglect or good \ncause.\u201d  Id.  The second sentence states that district \ncourts may \u201creopen the time for appeal for a period of \n14 days\u201d \u201cupon motion filed within 180 days after \nentry of the judgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier.\u201d  Id.  That \nrelief is available upon a finding that (1) the appellant \ndid not receive notice of the order in question \u201cwithin \n21 days of its entry\u201d and (2) \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2107(c)(1)\u2013(2).   \nAppellate Rules 4(a)(5) and (a)(6) implement \n\u00a7 2107(c).  Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first \nsentence.  Subsection (A) restates the statutory timing \nand \u201cgood cause\u201d requirements; subsection (B) \naddresses ex parte motions; and subsection (C) \n\n \n11 \n \n \nprovides that \u201c[n]o extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) \nmay exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting the \nmotion is entered, whichever is later.\u201d  Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(5).  Appellate Rule 4(a)(6), which governs \n\u201cReopening the Time to File an Appeal,\u201d implements \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.  It provides that district \ncourts \u201cmay reopen the time to file an appeal for a \nperiod of 14 days\u201d when \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s notice, timing, and \nprejudice requirements are satisfied.  Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. Factual Background \nDonte Parrish alleges that he spent years in harsh, \npunitive segregation for a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cCir.App.\u201d) at 84.  It all \nstarted when the Bureau of Prisons charged Parrish \nwith killing another inmate during a prison riot, as \nwell as with being present in an unauthorized area \nduring the same event.  See id.  Prison officials refused \nto provide Parrish with a hearing or other meaningful \nopportunity to contest those charges.  See Cir.App.31\u2013\n32, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355.  Nevertheless, they moved him \ninto segregation while the FBI commenced an \ninvestigation that took nearly six years to complete.  \nCir.App.31, 63, 84.   \nDuring most of his time in segregation, Parrish was \nisolated in a small cell.  Cir.App.34.  He was denied \naccess to his property, lost law library privileges, was \ndenied family visits, had difficulty contacting his \nlawyer, and was denied access to showers.  See \nCir.App.43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes restrained and \nforced to sleep in shackles.  Cir.App.74.  At one point, \n\n \n12 \n \n \nhe \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  Cir.App.45, 74.   \nParrish spent almost two years of his time in \nsegregation in FCI Lewisburg\u2019s Special Management \nUnit, Cir.App.44\u201345, which has been described as \u201cthe \nworst place in the federal prison system.\u201d1  After an \ninvestigation, the Office of the Inspector General \nconcluded that the unit\u2019s use of solitary confinement \nwas \u201cparticularly concerning.\u201d2  The Bureau of \nPrisons announced the unit\u2019s shutdown soon after \nthat OIG report was released.3 \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  Cir.App.63.  \nAfter he had spent nearly three years in segregation, \nthe Bureau of Prisons found that Parrish had \ncommitted \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged his \ndisciplinary record.  Cir.App.63, 77.   \n \n1 Justin Peters, How America\u2019s Model Prison Became the Most \nHorrific Facility in the Federal System, SLATE (Nov. 20, 2013), \nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-\nspecial-management-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-\nthe-most-horrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html (reporting \nthat inmates in the unit spent \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in cells \n\u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the same \ntime\u201d). \n2 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, \n17-05, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Use of Restrictive \nHousing for Inmates with Mental Illness 15\u201318 (2017), \nhttps://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf. \n3 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, \n24-113, Inspection of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Federal \nCorrectional \nInstitution \nLewisburg \n3 \nn.1 \n(2024), \nhttps://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/24-113.pdf. \n\n \n13 \n \n \nC. Procedural History \n1. \nParrish \nprepared \na \ncomplaint \nseeking \ncompensation for the years he had wrongfully spent in \nsegregation.  Cir.App.16\u201325, 132\u201334.  He signed the \ncomplaint and delivered it for mailing on April 7, \n2017.  Cir.App.22, 106.  The District Court received \nthat complaint and deemed it filed on May 3, 2017, \nnearly a month later.  Cir.App.25. \nThe District Court dismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an \nopinion and order dated March 23, 2020, and a \njudgment dated March 24, 2020.  Pet.App.55a, 57a, \n59a.  The court mailed both documents to USP \nThomson, the federal prison where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But by \nthat point, Parrish was in the process of being \ntransferred from federal to state custody.  Id. at 60a\u2013\n61a; D.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address); \nsee also Sentencing Memorandum of United States at \n4, Dkt. No. 147, United States v. Parrish, No. 05-cr-\n417 (M.D. Pa. May 23, 2024) (explaining that Parrish \nhad been released from federal custody on March 24, \n2020, after the United States agreed that his sentence \nwas unlawful).  \u201c[S]ervice of the [judgment] was \naccepted at USP Thomson on April 7, 2020.\u201d  \nPet.App.60a (citing D.Ct. Dkt. No. 132).  But \u201cthe \n[order] was returned as undelivered . . . .\u201d  Id.   \nParrish promptly filed a notice of change of address.  \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (April 14, 2020).  He then filed a \nsecond notice, along with a note \u201crequesting a docket \nsheet.\u201d  D.Ct. Dkt. No. 134 (June 9, 2020).  Upon \nreceiving the docket sheet, Parrish realized \u201cthat [his] \nlawsuit ha[d] been denied.\u201d  D.Ct. Dkt. No. 135 (June \n23, 2020).  So he filed a letter asking for \u201ca copy of the \n\n \n14 \n \n \njudge[\u2019]s last ruling sent to [his] new address.\u201d  Id.  In \nthe end, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nagainst him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat the earliest,\u201d \nPet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its entry and \nlong after the 60-day appeal period had expired, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted quickly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  On July 8, 2020, he filed a \ndocument entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; \nsee also D.Ct. Dkt. No. 131-1 (envelope).  In that \ndocument, Parrish explained the reason for his \ndelayed filing:  \u201cDue to my being transferred from \nFederal to State custody I did not receive this order \nuntil June 25, 2020.  It is now 7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this \nnotice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit \nconstrued the notice of appeal as a motion to reopen \nthe appeal period and remanded for the District Court \nto rule on that motion.  Pet.App.56a\u201358a.   \nOn remand, the District Court found that Parrish \nhad received notice of the judgment more than 21 days \nafter its entry, that he had moved for reopening within \n14 days of receiving notice, and that no party would \nbe prejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at \n61a (citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  The District Court \ntherefore reopened the appeal period for 14 days.  Id. \nat 61a\u201362a.  It further directed the clerk to \n\u201csupplement [the] record accordingly, and transmit \nthe same to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a.4 \n \n4 The District Court\u2019s reopening order contains a typo \nsuggesting that reopening was granted on January 8, 2020.  \nPet.App.62a.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, reopening was \nactually granted on January 8, 2021.  See Pet.App.5a.   \n\n \n15 \n \n \n3. Parrish\u2019s appeal thus returned to the Fourth \nCircuit.  There, both Parrish and the Government \nagreed that Parrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had \nbecome effective when the District Court reopened the \nappeal period.  See Ct.App. Dkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) \nat 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1.  That is how \nother appellate courts treat notices of appeal filed \nafter the ordinary appeal period has expired but \nbefore reopening is granted.  See Winters v. Taskila, \n88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nWithers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th Cir. 2011); \nHolden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 WL 274489, \nat *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022); Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., 825 F. App\u2019x 383, 386\u201387 (7th Cir. 2020); \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998).   \nA divided panel of the Fourth Circuit rejected that \nconsensus position.  The panel majority acknowledged \nthat notices of appeal filed after the ordinary appeal \nperiod expires ripen when a district court grants an \nextension \nunder \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nfirst \nsentence.  \nPet.App.11a.  It reasoned, however, that the word \n\u201creopen\u201d precludes a previously filed notice of appeal \nfrom ripening when a district court grants reopening \nunder \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.  See id. at 5a\u20136a, \n9a\u201312a.  The panel majority also suggested that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s earlier filing\u201d could no longer serve as a \nnotice of appeal because it \u201cha[d] already been \nconstrued\u201d as a motion to reopen.  Id. at 3a\u20134a.  The \nmajority thus deemed Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal \nineffective.  And because Parrish had not filed a \nsecond notice of appeal during the 14-day reopening \n\n \n16 \n \n \nwindow, it dismissed his appeal for lack of \njurisdiction.  Pet.App.2a.   \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He found \nno second-notice \u201crequirement in the text of \n\u00a7 2107(c),\u201d id. at 18a, and would have held that \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal ripened when reopening was \ngranted.  See id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory \nopined that the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted distinction\u201d \nbetween reopening an appeal period and extending it \n\u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 20a.  He also \nrejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \u201cParrish\u2019s July \n2020 filing cannot simultaneously serve as both a \nnotice of appeal and a motion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  The panel denied rehearing over Judge \nGregory\u2019s dissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the \nFourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of \n9-to-6.  Id. at 63a\u201364a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a \nstatement in support of the en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u2013\n67a.  Judge Gregory, joined by three other judges, \nwrote a dissent.  Id. at 67a\u201369a.  \u201cAt its core,\u201d the \ndissenters explained, \u201cthis case requires us to \ndetermine whether access to [appellate courts] should \nbe foreclosed for failure to refile a notice of appeal \nduring the newly reopened period following success \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a. The panel\u2019s ruling, the \ndissenters recognized, had created a circuit \u201csplit.\u201d  Id. \nat 68a.  And it will have a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects,\u201d often denying them any meaningful \nopportunity to appeal.  Id. at 68a\u201369a.   \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Notices of appeal filed after the original appeal \nperiod expires ripen when the appeal period reopens. \nA. This Court and the Federal Rules take a \nfunctional approach to notices of appeal, particularly \nfor pro se litigants.  So long as notices of appeal afford \nadequate notice, purely technical defects do not \nrender them ineffective.  For decades, courts\u2014\nincluding this Court\u2014have taken the same functional \napproach to notices of appeal that are filed too early.  \nPremature notices usually afford more notice, not \nless.  As a result, they generally ripen when an appeal \nperiod opens.  That ripening principle is reflected in \nthe Federal Rules.  In fact, it is so well established \nthat rulemakers expressly disclaim it where it does \nnot apply. \nB. Section 2107 incorporates the same ripening \nprinciple.  Nothing in \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s text requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative notice of appeal after the \nappeal period reopens.  To the contrary, \u00a7 2107(c) \nincorporates the notice of appeal requirement set \nforth in \u00a7 2107(a), which provides that a notice of \nappeal need only be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after\u201d the \norder on appeal\u2014i.e., before the jurisdictional \ndeadline.  Ordinary ripening rules apply to notices of \nappeal filed before the \u00a7 2107(a) clock starts ticking.  \nThere is no textual basis for treating \u00a7 2107(c) any \ndifferently.  Indeed, historical context confirms that \npremature notices of appeal ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nsecond sentence, just as they do under the statute\u2019s \nother provisions.  The \u201cno prejudice\u201d standard baked \ninto \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s text captures the ripening principle \nperfectly.    \n\n \n18 \n \n \nC. Applying the ripening principle results in a clear \nand sensible jurisdictional rule.  Litigants that benefit \nfrom reopening orders are almost always incarcerated \npeople acting pro se\u2014a category of litigants that often \nfails to receive timely notice of court orders due to \ncircumstances far beyond their control.  A second-\nnotice requirement is a tripwire that pro se litigants \n(and even lawyers) may fail to spot.  And even those \nwho realize that a second notice is required may have \nno way to file one during the 14-day reopening \nwindow.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule, those \nlitigants will lose their right to appeal through no \nfault of their own\u2014and for no conceivable reason, \nsince reopening can be granted only when \u201cno party \n[will] be prejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nII. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s justifications for its second-\nnotice requirement fall flat. \nA. The Fourth Circuit primarily relied on an \nattempted distinction between the word \u201creopen\u201d and \nthe word \u201cextend.\u201d  According to the court, notices of \nappeal ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence because \nan \u201cextension\u201d retroactively creates a continuous \nappeal period, but they do not ripen under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s \nsecond \nsentence \nbecause \n\u201creopening\u201d \nworks \ndifferently.  That logic fails at every step.  Ripening \ndoes not hinge on the fiction that an untimely notice \nof appeal was timely all along.  That is not how \nextensions work, in any event:  Like reopening \nmotions, extension motions can be granted either \nbefore or after the original appeal period expires.  \nCongress\u2019s use of different terms merely reflects the \nobvious differences between the two mechanisms.  \nThere is no way to read the word \u201creopen\u201d as implicitly \ndislodging the ripening principle that applies in every \n\n \n19 \n \n \nother context\u2014much less as imposing a second-notice \nrequirement for reopening only.   \nB. The Fourth Circuit also briefly suggested that \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal could no longer be \nconsidered a notice of appeal once it had been \nconstrued as a motion to reopen.  Apparently, the \nFourth Circuit doesn\u2019t think a single filing can work \ntwo jobs at once.  This Court has already held, \nhowever, that notices of appeal can do exactly that.   \nARGUMENT \nI. \nNOTICES \nOF APPEAL FILED AFTER \nTHE \nORDINARY APPEAL PERIOD EXPIRES RIPEN \nWHEN THE APPEAL PERIOD IS REOPENED. \nNotices of appeal that are filed too early generally \nbecome effective when an appeal clock starts running.  \nThat background ripening principle\u2014which follows \nfrom the functional approach to notices of appeal\u2014is \nreflected both in caselaw and in the Federal Rules.  \nCongress baked it into \u00a7 2107\u2019s text.  And it yields a \nsimple, workable rule that avoids stripping pro se \nlitigants of their right to appeal and prejudices no one.  \nA. Premature notices of appeal generally \ntake effect when an appeal period \nopens. \nCourts and rulemakers take a functional approach \nto notices of appeal, particularly for pro se litigants.  \nConsistent with that approach, this Court and others \nhave long recognized\u2014across a wide variety of \ncontexts\u2014that premature notices of appeal generally \n\n \n20 \n \n \nripen when an appeal period begins.  That background \nprinciple is also reflected in the Federal Rules.   \n1. Notices of appeal serve an important purpose:  \nThey inform parties and courts that a particular \nlitigant wishes to challenge a particular court order.  \nSee Smith, 502 U.S. at 248.  But the notice-of-appeal \nrequirement is not meant to be a landmine.  \n\u201c[I]mperfect . . . compliance\u201d with formal rules is not \ndisqualifying.  Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 \nU.S. 312, 315 (1988); see also Hoiness v. United States, \n335 U.S. 297, 300 (1948) (explaining that \u201cniceties of \nform\u201d are immaterial and \u201cdefect[s] . . . of . . . a \ntechnical nature\u201d should be \u201cdisregarded\u201d); Fed. R. \nApp. P. 3(c)(7) (\u201cAn appeal must not be dismissed for \ninformality of form or title of the notice of appeal, for \nfailure to name a party whose intent to appeal is \notherwise clear from the notice, or for failure to \nproperly designate the judgment if the notice of \nappeal was filed after entry of the judgment and \ndesignates \nan \norder \nthat \nmerged \ninto \nthat \njudgment.\u201d). \nA notice of appeal is fit for purpose so long as it \nactually provides adequate notice.  See Smith, 502 \nU.S. at 248 (\u201c[T]he notice afforded by a document . . . \ndetermines the document\u2019s sufficiency as a notice of \nappeal.\u201d).  To do that, a notice of appeal need only \nleave \u201cno genuine doubt . . . about who is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, [and] to which appellate court.\u201d  \nBecker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 767 (2001) \n(reversing court of appeals for dismissing an appeal \nbecause the appellant had failed to sign the notice of \nappeal); see also Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181 \n(1962) (notice of appeal sufficient where \u201cpetitioner\u2019s \nintention to seek review of\u201d particular judgments \u201cwas \n\n \n21 \n \n \nmanifest\u201d); Hoiness, 335 U.S. at 301 (notice of appeal \nsufficient where \u201c[w]hat appellant sought to have \nreviewed was plain\u201d).   \nThe functional approach to notices of appeal echoes \nbroader requirements that courts elevate function \nover form.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 61 \nprovides that, \u201c[a]t every stage of the proceeding, the \ncourt must disregard all errors and defects that do not \naffect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 61.  And first among all Rules of Civil Procedure is \nthe general principle that Rules \u201cshould be construed, \nadministered, and employed by the court and the \nparties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive \ndetermination of every action and proceeding.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 1.  \u201cIt is . . . entirely contrary to the spirit of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on \nthe merits to be avoided on the basis of . . . mere \ntechnicalities.\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 181. \nThe functional approach to notices of appeal also \nfollows from this Court\u2019s consistent refrain that pro se \nfilings must be construed generously.  See, e.g., \nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per \ncuriam) (\u201cA document filed pro se is \u2018to be liberally \nconstrued[.]\u2019\u201d (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, \n106 (1976))).  Most of this Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional \napproach\u201d cases have involved notices of appeal filed \nby pro se litigants.  This Court has always afforded \nthose notices of appeal the same liberal construction \nit affords other pro se filings.  See, e.g., Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248\u201350 (construing \u201cinformal brief\u201d filed \nby pro se litigant as a notice of appeal); Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767\u201368 (deeming pro se notice of appeal \nsufficient even though unsigned); cf. also Houston v. \nLack, 487 U.S. 266, 270 (1988) (holding that a notice \n\n \n22 \n \n \nof appeal filed by an incarcerated pro se litigant is \nsufficient if delivered to prison authorities by the \njurisdictional deadline); Fallen v. United States, 378 \nU.S. 139, 142\u201344 (1964) (similar). \n2. This Court has applied this same functional \napproach to premature notices of appeal.  In FirsTier, \nthis Court considered a notice of appeal filed \u201cafter the \nDistrict Court announced from the bench that it \nintended to grant summary judgment for respondent, \nbut before entry of judgment.\u201d  498 U.S. at 270.  The \nquestion before the Court was whether that notice \nwas \u201cfatally premature,\u201d given that the appeal period \ndid not begin running until judgment was entered.  Id. \nat 272.  The answer was no.  See id. at 273\u201374.  \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca notice of appeal \u2018filed after the announcement \nof a decision or order but before the entry of the \njudgment or order shall be treated as filed after such \nentry and on the day thereof.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 272\u201373 (quoting \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2)).  As the Court recognized, that \nRule reflects \u201ca general practice in the courts of \nappeals of deeming certain premature notices of \nappeal effective.\u201d  Id. at 273 (citing, e.g., In re Grand \nJury Impaneled Jan. 21, 1975, 541 F.2d 373, 377 (3d \nCir. 1976)).  This Court endorsed that practice, \nholding that \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity . . . \nshould not be allowed to extinguish an otherwise \nproper appeal\u201d when it \u201cdo[es] not prejudice the \nappellee.\u201d  Id.; see also id. at 274\u201375 (rejecting the \nargument that this practice \u201cenlarg[ed] appellate \njurisdiction\u201d). \nFirsTier variously described the premature-notice \nprinciple in terms of \u201cripen[ing],\u201d \u201crelat[ion] forward,\u201d \nand becoming \u201ceffective.\u201d  Id. at 275, 277.  However \n\n \n23 \n \n \nlabeled, the principle has been applied \u201cquite \ngenerally\u201d in civil cases for decades.  Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdvisory Committee Notes on 1979 Amendment.  See, \ne.g., United States v. Valdosta-Lowndes Cnty. Hosp. \nAuth., 668 F.2d 1177, 1178 n.2 (11th Cir. 1982) (notice \nfiled after entry of judgment but before decision on \nJNOV motion); Tilden Fin. Corp v. Palo Tire Serv., \nInc., 596 F.2d 604, 606\u201307 (3d Cir. 1979) (notice filed \nbefore appellant obtained Rule 54(b) certification); \nRicherson v. Jones, 551 F.2d 918, 922\u201323 (3d Cir. \n1977) (notice filed after merits ruling but before ruling \non attorney\u2019s fees); Jetco Elec. Indus. v. Gardiner, 473 \nF.2d 1228, 1231 (5th Cir. 1973) (notice filed after entry \nof judgment against appellant but before resolution of \nclaims against other parties); Morris v. Uhl & Lopez \nEng\u2019rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247, 1250\u201351 (10th Cir. 1971) \n(same, in slightly different configuration); Merchants \n& Planters Bank v. Smith, 516 F.2d 355, 356 n.3 (8th \nCir. 1975) (same, in slightly different configuration); \nEason v. Dickson, 390 F.2d 585, 587\u201388 (9th Cir. 1968) \n(notice filed after denial of motion to convene three-\njudge district court, which appellant believed disposed \nof his claims on the merits); Markham v. Holt, \n369 F.2d 940, 941\u201342 (5th Cir. 1966) (notice filed after \nentry of order granting summary judgment but before \nentry of judgment).   \nThis Court applied the same principle in the \ncriminal context more than three-quarters of a \ncentury ago.  In Lemke v. United States, 346 U.S. 325 \n(1953) (per curiam), the defendant filed a notice of \nappeal on March 11, but judgment was not entered \nuntil March 14.  See id. at 326.  \u201cSince no notice of \nappeal was filed after that time,\u201d the lower court \n\u201cdismissed [the appeal] as premature.\u201d  Id.  This Court \n\n \n24 \n \n \nreversed that ruling and reinstated the appeal.  \u201cThe \nnotice of appeal filed on March 11,\u201d it recognized, \u201cwas \n. . . still on file on March 14 and gave full notice after \nthat date, as well as before, of the sentence and \njudgment which petitioner challenged.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe notice of appeal\u2019s \u201cirregularity\u201d did \u201cnot affect \nsubstantial rights,\u201d it was sufficient.  Id. (quoting Fed. \nR. Crim. P. 52(a)).5   \n3. By 1979, the ripening principle was so well \nestablished that rulemakers had to expressly \nenumerate circumstances in which premature notices \nshould not be allowed to ripen.  That year, the Rules \nCommittee amended Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) to provide \nthat \u201c[a] notice of appeal filed before the disposition of \n[certain post-judgment motions] shall have no effect.\u201d  \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) (1979); see Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdv. Comm. Notes on 1993 Amendment (discussing \nthe 1979 rule).  Prior to that amendment, courts of \nappeals had generally treated such notices as \nsufficient, recognizing that they ripened once post-\njudgment motions were resolved.  See Acosta v. La. \nDep\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs., 478 U.S. 251, 254 \n(1986) (per curiam) (explaining that the amended \nRule created an exception to the \u201cgeneral rule that a \nnotice of appeal filed after announcement of an order \nbut before its entry in the docket will be deemed \ntimely filed\u201d); Williams v. Bolger, 633 F.2d 410, 412 \n(5th Cir. 1980) (acknowledging that the amendment \nhad \u201coverrule[d] several\u201d of the court\u2019s \u201cprevious \ndecisions\u201d).  But changes to appeal-docketing \n \n5 As this Court recognized in Manrique v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 116 (2017), \u201cthe Lemke petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal would \nnow be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).\u201d  Id. at 125.   \n\n \n25 \n \n \nprocedures had resulted in a \u201cbroad class of situations \n. . . in which district courts and courts of appeals \nwould both have had the power to modify the same \njudgment.\u201d  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount \nCo., 459 U.S. 56, 59\u201360 (1982).  \u201cThe 1979 \nAmendments avoided that potential conflict\u201d by \ntreating a notice of appeal as void\u2014i.e., \u201cas if no notice \nof appeal [had been] filed at all\u201d\u2014once certain post-\njudgment motions were filed.  Id. at 60, 61.   \nAt the same time it amended Rule 4(a)(4) to \npreclude ripening in some contexts, the Rules \nCommittee added Rule 4(a)(2), which expressly \nprovided for ripening in others.  That provision, which \n\u201ccodif[ied]\u201d existing practice in part, FirsTier, 498 U.S. \nat 273, states that \u201c[a] notice of appeal filed after the \ncourt announces a decision or order\u2014but before the \nentry of the judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on \nthe date of and after the entry,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. Notes (1979) \n(citing, as examples of the particular application of \nripening it acknowledged, In re Grand Jury, 541 F.2d \n373; Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87 (3d Cir. 1976); Song \nJook Suh v. Rosenberg, 437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); \nRuby v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, 365 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); \nand Firchau v. Diamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269 \n(9th Cir. 1965)). \nRule 4(a)(2)\u2019s ripening provision survives today.  \nRule 4(a)(4)\u2019s anti-ripening exception does not.  In \n1993, the Rules Committee amended Rule 4(a)(4) to \nrestore the ripening principle\u2019s applicability to post-\njudgment motions.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1993).  As the Committee recognized, \u201c[m]any \nlitigants, especially pro se litigants,\u201d had \u201cfail[ed] to \nfile the second notice of appeal\u201d the Rule required\u2014\n\n \n26 \n \n \nand so had lost the opportunity to appeal.  Id.; see \nAverhart v. Arredondo, 773 F.2d 919, 920 (7th Cir. \n1985) (Posner, J.) (recognizing that such mistakes are \n\u201cthoroughly understandable,\u201d because \u201c[t]he idea that \nthe first notice of appeal lapses . . . is not intuitive\u201d).  \nRule 4(a)(4)(B)(i) now expressly incorporates the \nripening principle, providing that notices of appeal \nfiled \u201cafter the court announces or enters a \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of [post-judgment \nmotions]\u2014 . . . become[ ] effective . . . when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining motion is \nentered.\u201d   \nThe Rules\u2019 brief dalliance with a narrow exception \nto the ripening principle had no effect on the \nprinciple\u2019s application in other contexts.  Courts \ncontinued to treat other premature notices of appeal \nas sufficient even while the anti-ripening version of \nRule 4(a)(4) was in effect.  See, e.g., Alcorn County v. \nU.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1166 \n(5th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[A] premature notice of appeal does \ninvoke appellate jurisdiction except in the narrow \ncircumstances described in Rule 4(a)(4).\u201d); Cape May \nGreene, Inc. v. Warren, 698 F.2d 179, 185 (3d Cir. \n1983) (\u201c[T]he prohibition against giving effect to \npremature notices of appeal shall be confined to the \nspecific instances cited in Rule 4(a)(4).\u201d).   \nNor has the Rules\u2019 express incorporation of the \nripening principle in some contexts limited its \napplication in others.  Indeed, courts consistently \nacknowledge that notices of appeal filed too early \nripen in circumstances not expressly contemplated by \nthe Rules.  For example, notices of appeal filed after \nan interlocutory order but before Rule 54(b) \ncertification ripen when the order is certified.  See, \n\n \n27 \n \n \ne.g., Clausen v. SEA-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1184\u201385 \n(1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases from Second, Fourth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits); \nLiberty Bell Bank v. Rogers, 726 F. App\u2019x 147, 150 n.5 \n(3d Cir. 2018); Swope v. Columbian Chems. Co., 281 \nF.3d 185, 191\u201394 (5th Cir. 2002); Good v. Ohio Edison \nCo., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Wilson v. Navistar \nInt\u2019l Transp. Corp., 193 F.3d 1212, 1213 (11th Cir. \n1999).  And notices of appeal filed after the original \nappeal period expires ripen when the appeal period is \nextended under \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence.  See Moore \nv. Nelson, 611 F.2d 434, 436 n.4 (2d Cir. 1979); Evans \nv. Jones, 366 F.2d 772, 773 (4th Cir. 1966); Cuevas v. \nReading & Bates Corp., 770 F.2d 1371, 1375, 1377 \n(5th Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds, In re Air \nCrash Disaster Near New Orleans, 821 F.2d 1147, \n1163 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc); Van Orman v. \nPurkett, 43 F.3d 1201, 1202 (8th Cir. 1994); United \nStates v. Layton, 855 F.2d 1388, 1416 (9th Cir. 1988); \nN. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., \n527 F.3d 1033, 1039 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Consol. \nFreightways Corp. of Del. v. Larson, 827 F.2d 916, 921 \n(3d Cir. 1987). \nB. Section \n2107(c) \nincorporates \nthat \nripening principle. \nSection 2107(c) was enacted in 1991, right on \nFirsTier\u2019s heels and after the ripening principle had \nbeen established for decades.  See Pub. L. 102-198, \n\u00a7 12 (Dec. 9, 1991); supra 22\u201327.  The provision\u2019s text, \nstructure, and history all indicate that the reopening \nmechanism incorporates the background ripening \nprinciple.  Like other premature notices of appeal that \nprovide adequate notice, notices of appeal filed after \n\n \n28 \n \n \nthe original appeal period expires take effect when the \nappeal period is reopened. \nText. Jurisdictional requirements spring only from \nclear statements in statutory text.  See, e.g., Wilkins \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 152, 158\u201360 (2023) (courts \napply \u201cthe jurisdictional label\u201d only when Congress \nhas made a \u201cclear statement\u201d that a provision \u201ctruly \noperates as a limit on a court\u2019s subject-matter \njurisdiction\u201d); Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., \n583 U.S. 17, 19 (2017) (\u201c[A] time limit prescribed only \nin a court-made rule . . . is not jurisdictional.\u201d).  \nSection 2107(c) authorizes courts to \u201creopen the time \nfor appeal for a period of 14 days from the date of entry \nof the order reopening the time for appeal.\u201d  The \nprovision contains no statement\u2014much less a clear \none\u2014that appellate courts lack jurisdiction unless an \nappellant files a notice of appeal after reopening.  \nSection 2107(c) does not even mention notices of \nappeal.  Nor does it say anything about what \nappellants must do during the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  In the absence of a clear statement, there can \nbe no jurisdictional requirement that litigants who \nhave already filed an otherwise-sufficient notice of \nappeal file a second one during the reopening window. \nStructure. Section 2107\u2019s broader structure \nconfirms that subsection (c) incorporates the ripening \ndefault rule.  Subsection (a) creates the notice-of-\nappeal requirement; subsections (b) and (c) simply set \ndifferent deadlines for completing that requirement.  \nRipening is available under subsections (a) and (b).  \nThe notice-of-appeal requirement must mean the \nsame thing for subsection (c).  \n\n \n29 \n \n \nSubsection (c) does not itself set out a requirement \nto file a notice of appeal.  It provides only for reopening \nof \u201cthe time for appeal.\u201d  The obligation to file a notice \nof appeal comes from subsection (a), which contains \n\u00a7 2107\u2019s \nonly \nreference \nto \nnotices \nof \nappeal.  \nSubsection (a) requires that a notice of appeal be filed \n\u201cwithin thirty days after the entry of\u201d the decision at \nissue, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section.\u201d \nSubsections (b) and (c) provide otherwise.  Both \nsubsections \nincorporate \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement in subsection (a), but they set different \ndeadlines in certain categories of cases.  Where \nsubsection (b) applies, \u201cthe time\u201d is \u201c60 days from such \nentry.\u201d  And under subsection (c), courts may \u201cextend \nthe time for appeal\u201d or \u201creopen the time for appeal for \na period of 14 days.\u201d  In both provisions, \u201cthe time\u201d \nand \u201cthe time for appeal\u201d refer back to the only \ncomplete \nstatement \nof \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement in \u00a7 2107: subsection (a)\u2019s requirement \nthat a notice of appeal be filed \u201cwithin thirty days \nafter\u201d an order\u2019s entry.   \nThe operative language in subsection (a)\u2014\u201cwithin \n30 days after the entry\u201d\u2014is consistent with the \nripening principle.  That phrase specifies both the \nlatest time a notice of appeal can be filed and the event \nfrom which that deadline is measured.  When used in \nthe deadline context, the preposition \u201cwithin\u201d means \n\u201cbefore the end of.\u201d  \u201cWithin,\u201d Merriam-Webster \n(2025); see also \u201cWithin,\u201d Collins Dictionary (2025) \n(\u201cnot beyond in distance, time, degree, range, scope, \netc.\u201d); \u201cWithin,\u201d Oxford English Dictionary (2025) (\u201cIn \nthe limits of (a period of time); most usually, before \nthe end of, after not more than\u201d; \u201cNot beyond or above \n(a specified or implied amount or degree); at, in, or of \n\n \n30 \n \n \nless than or not more than; so as not to exceed or \nsurpass\u201d); Cambridge English Dictionary, English \nGrammar Today (\u201cWithin stresses that something is \n. . . \nnot \nlater \nthan \na \nparticular \ntime.\u201d), \nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-\ngrammar/within.  So in subsection (a), \u201cwithin\u201d sets \nthe date by which a notice of appeal must be filed.  \nAnd the phrase \u201cafter the entry\u201d anchors that \ndeadline to a specific point in time\u2014i.e., it tells you \nwhich day to start counting. \nThe notice-of-appeal requirement in subsection (a) \nis therefore consistent with ripening.  Notices of \nappeal are filed \u201cwithin\u201d the appeal period so long as \nthey are filed before the deadline.  See Smith, 502 U.S. \nat 248\u201349 (\u201cIf a document filed within the time \nspecified by Rule 4 gives the notice required by Rule \n3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.\u201d).  That is just as \ntrue for premature notices of appeal as it is for notices \nof appeal filed after the appeal period begins.  After \nall, a premature notice is \u201cstill on file\u201d\u2014in other \nwords, \u201cis filed,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a)\u2014when the \nappeal period begins to run, and it gives \u201cfull notice \n[of the appeal] after that date, as well as before.\u201d  \nLemke, 346 U.S. at 326.   \nAs explained above, courts have long held exactly \nthat with respect to appeal periods governed by \nsubsections (a) and (b).  See supra 22\u201327 (collecting \ncases holding that notices of appeal filed before entry \nof the appealable order ripen when the appeal period \nopens under subsections (a) and (b)).  They have \nreached the same result for appeal periods governed \nby subsection (c)\u2019s first sentence, which addresses \nextensions.  See supra 27.   \n\n \n31 \n \n \nAs every circuit save the Fourth has also \nrecognized, there is no textual basis for treating \nsubsection (c)\u2019s second sentence any differently.  See \nsupra 27 (collecting cases holding that notices of \nappeal filed after the original appeal period expires \nripen when the appeal period is reopened).  Each \nsubsection of \u00a7 2107 uses different language to set \ndifferent deadlines.  But the same language in \nsubsection \n(a) \ncreates \nthe \nnotice-of-appeal \nrequirement for all three subsections.  That \nrequirement must work the same way across the \nentire statute.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (where one statutory term \u201capplies without \ndifferentiation to\u201d a set of \u201ccategories,\u201d construing it \nto perform different work as to \u201ceach category \nwould . . . invent a statute,\u201d not \u201cinterpret one\u201d).   \nHistory. Historical context points in the same \ndirection.  Subsection (c) was added to \u00a7 2107 in 1991, \nwhen Congress acted on a suggestion in the Advisory \nCommittee\u2019s Notes on Rule 4.  Pub. L. 102-198, \u00a7 12 \n(Dec. 9, 1991) (\u201cConformity with Rules of Appellate \nProcedure\u201d); see Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. Notes \n(1991) (\u201crecommend[ing],\u201d in a \u201cTransmittal Note,\u201d \nthat \u00a7 2107 \u201cmight appropriately be revised in light of \nth[e] proposed [Rule 4(a)(6)]\u201d).  By that point, as this \nCourt had recognized just a few months earlier, there \nwas a well-established \u201cgeneral practice in the courts \nof appeals of deeming certain premature notices of \nappeal effective.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; see supra \n22\u201326.  The functional approach to notices of appeal \nwas also long settled.  See supra 20\u201322.  Against that \nbackdrop, \nthe \ndrafters \nof \nthe \nFederal \nRules \nunderstood that premature notices of appeal would \n\n \n32 \n \n \nripen when an appeal period opened absent an \nexpress provision to the contrary.  See supra 25.   \nCongress would have understood that too.  And \nwhen it added \u00a7 2107(c) to expand access to appellate \nreview, it said nothing to prevent the background \nripening principle from operating on \u00a7 2107(c) the \nsame way it does on the statute\u2019s first two subsections.  \nCf. Arellano v. McDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 6 (2023) \n(equitable \ntolling \nforms \nthe \n\u201cjurisprudential \nbackdrop\u201d for interpreting limitations periods); Peter \nv.

Compare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2) \n(authorizing reopening only upon a finding that \u201cno \nparty would be prejudiced\u201d), with FirsTier, 498 U.S. at \n273 (recognizing that \u201cprematurity . . . should not be \nallowed to extinguish an otherwise proper appeal\u201d \nwhere the \u201cpremature notice[ ] do[es] not prejudice \nthe appellee\u201d); see also, e.g., Firchau, 345 F.2d at 271 \n(notice sufficient when \u201cpremature filing\u201d did not \n\u201caffect[] substantial rights\u201d); Markham, 369 F.2d at \n942 (standard for ripening is whether \u201cprejudice will \nresult to the appellee\u201d); Song Jook Suh, 437 F.2d \n\n \n33 \n \n \nat 1100 (premature notice sufficient where no one was \nprejudiced); Eason, 390 F.2d at 588 (\u201cthe test [for \nripening] was one of prejudice or its absence\u201d); Morris, \n442 F.2d at 1250 (permitting ripening when \u201cno \nprejudice could result to any one\u201d); Hodge, 507 F.2d at \n89 (permitting ripening when \u201cthe non-appealing \nparty is not prejudiced by the prematurity\u201d); In re \nGrand Jury, 541 F.2d at 376\u201377 (permitting ripening \nbecause \u201cthe government ha[d] not been prejudiced by \nthe prematurity\u201d); Richerson, 551 F.2d at 922\u201323 \n(permitting ripening \u201cin the absence of a showing of \nprejudice to the other party\u201d); Tilden Fin.

Notices filed after \nexpiration of the ordinary appeal period but before \nreopening are necessarily filed after judgment.  So \nthey \u201cprovide[ ] sufficient notice to other parties and \nthe courts\u201d of the grounds for the appeal.  Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248; compare Manrique, 581 U.S. at 123\u2013\n25 (premature notice insufficient when filed before \n\u201cthe court has . . . decided the issue that the appellant \nseeks to appeal\u201d), and Sacks v. Rothberg, 845 F.2d \n1098, 1099 & n.* (D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam) \n(observing that every circuit recognizes this limitation \nin civil cases, too), with Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7) \n(providing that \u201cfailure to properly designate the \n\n \n34 \n \n \njudgment\u201d is not grounds for dismissal \u201cif the notice of \nappeal was filed after entry\u201d).  Indeed, they \nnecessarily provide appellees and courts with more \nnotice than post-reopening notices, not less.  See \nLemke, 346 U.S. at 326 (recognizing that premature \nnotices of appeal give \u201cfull notice after\u201d the appeal \nperiod begins, \u201cas well as before\u201d); Fed. R. App. P. 4, \nAdv. Comm. Notes to 1993 Amendment (observing \nthat an appellee would receive \u201csufficient notice of the \nappellant\u2019s intentions\u201d from a premature notice).  \nSection 2107(c) thus fits comfortably within the \nripening tradition against which it was enacted. \nC. Ripening upon reopening is a simple \njurisdictional \nrule \nthat \npreserves \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s purpose. \nApplying ordinary ripening principles results in a \nstraightforward jurisdictional rule that benefits \nparties and courts alike.  It also avoids undermining \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s purpose, which was to preserve appellate \nrights for litigants who fail to receive timely notice of \na judgment through no fault of their own.  The Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsecond-notice \nrequirement \nguts \nthe \nreopening mechanism by rendering it ineffective for \nmany of the people who need it most. \n1. Jurisdictional rules \u201chave a unique potential to \ndisrupt the orderly course of litigation.\u201d  Wilkins, 598 \nU.S. at 157.  They have \u201cdrastic\u201d consequences, \ndepriving courts of the power to resolve disputes no \nmatter the equities.  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. \n428, 435 (2011).  And they force courts to issue-spot \nwithout party assistance\u2014and even sometimes (as \nhere) against party agreement.  See id. at 434 \n(\u201c[F]ederal courts have an independent obligation to \n\n \n35 \n \n \nensure that they do not exceed the scope of their \njurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide \njurisdictional questions that the parties either \noverlook or elect not to press.\u201d).  For these reasons, \n\u201csimplicity is a major virtue\u201d for jurisdictional rules.  \nHertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010).   \nThis \nCourt \nhas \nlong \nendorsed \na \nsimple \njurisdictional rule for notices of appeal:  If a notice is \nfunctionally sufficient\u2014i.e., if it actually provides \nadequate notice before the jurisdictional deadline\u2014it \ndoes the trick.  See supra 20\u201322.  That simple rule has \na simple corollary:  Notices of appeal filed after the \nordinary appeal period expires ripen when reopening \nis granted.  That is a straightforward, intuitive rule \nthat can readily be applied in every case.  It also \navoids creating a second-notice tripwire that litigants \nmust spot\u2014or else pay the jurisdictional price.   \n2. Reading \u00a7 2107(c) to set that trap would make the \nreopening mechanism virtually useless for the very \npeople it serves: pro se litigants in general, and \nincarcerated pro se litigants in particular.   \nBecause reopening is available only for litigants \nwho do not receive notice of an adverse ruling within \n21 days, pro se litigants are its almost-exclusive \nbeneficiaries.  The reason for that is straightforward:  \nWhereas lawyers now almost always receive instant \nelectronic notice, pro se litigants usually must grapple \nwith old-fashioned mail.  Compare Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 5(d)(3)(a) (\u201cA person represented by an attorney \nmust file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is \nallowed by the court for good cause or required by local \nrule.\u201d), with Federal Judicial Center, Federal Courts\u2019 \nElectronic Filing by Pro Se Litigants 1, 3, 7\u20138 (2022), \n\n \n36 \n \n \nhttps://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/materials/20/\nFederalCourtProSeECF.pdf (finding that only around \nhalf of federal district courts permit pro se litigants to \nfile electronically and that \u201c[p]risoners cannot use \nCM/ECF\u201d even in those jurisdictions).  And despite \nthe postal service\u2019s best efforts, \u201csnow [or] rain [or] \nheat [or] gloom of night\u201d can sometimes \u201cstay[]\u201d even \nthe finest \u201ccourier from swift completion of their \nappointed rounds.\u201d  U.S. Postal Service, Postal Service \nMission and \u201cMotto,\u201d https://about.usps.com/who/\nprofile/history/pdf/mission-motto.pdf; see U.S. Postal \nService, Analysis of FY 2023 Performance 31 (2024), \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/\n2803_2804%20Report_Final.pdf (finding that \u201cthe \nPostal Service failed to meet six out of its eight targets \nfor\u201d first-class mail products \u201c[i]n FY 2023,\u201d including \nlate delivery of nearly 20 percent of mail meant to be \ndelivered within three to five days); U.S. Postal \nService Office of Inspector General, Spring 2024 \nSemiannual \nReport \nto \nCongress \n16 \n(2024), \nhttps://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/\n2024-05/FY2024_Spring_SARC.pdf \n(reporting \nproblems with timely mail delivery in 95% of audited \nlocations).     \nIncarcerated pro se litigants face further obstacles \nto timely notice.  Not only are they \u201cforced\u201d \u201cto entrust \ntheir appeals to the vagaries of the mail,\u201d they also \nmust rely on \u201cprison authorities whom [they] cannot \ncontrol or supervise\u201d to forward incoming mail \npromptly.  Houston, 487 U.S. at 271.  It takes time for \nprisons to process, screen, and distribute incoming \nmail in the best of circumstances.  See, e.g., Pa. Dep\u2019t \nof Corr., Mail (setting target of \u201c6\u20138 days for inmates \nto receive their mail\u201d after it arrives at the prison), \n\n \n37 \n \n \nhttps://www.pa.gov/agencies/cor/resources/for-family-\nand-friends/mail.html; Cal.

And circumstances are of \ncourse not always ideal.  See, e.g., Young v. Kenney, \n949 F.3d 995, 997 (6th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (movant \ndid not receive notice of order because he had been \n\u201cplaced in the prison\u2019s psychiatric unit\u201d and was \u201cnot \npermitted to have property in [his] possession\u201d); \nUnited States v.

Incarcerated people are \nmoved frequently and for a variety of reasons.  See \nU.S. Marshals Service, JPATS: A Day in the Life of \nPrisoner Transports (Aug. 23, 2024) (U.S. Marshals \nperform \u201cover 200,000 prisoner movements yearly,\u201d \nincluding for \u201cdisciplinary reasons, court and study \n\n \n38 \n \n \norders, mental health evaluations, and attorney \nspecial requests\u201d), https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/\nstories/jpats-day-life-of-prisoner-transports; see also, \ne.g., Cir.App.150\u201351 (documenting at least 18 such \nmoves across 12 years).  These moves often happen \nwithout notice, and can leave prisoners without any \nmeans of updating the court in a timely fashion.  See, \ne.g., Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr. Standard Operating Proc. \n222.01 at 7 (Oct. 24, 2023) (\u201cFor reasons dictated by \ngood security practices,\u201d approved transfers \u201cshall \nalways \nbe \nkept \nconfidential \nand \nunder \nno \ncircumstances shared with the offender or [his] \ncontacts\u201d in advance); N.Y.

The resulting delays can be \nsubstantial.  See, e.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 667 (order \n\u201ctook months to reach\u201d the appellant because he had \nbeen moved to a different prison); Reho v. United \nStates, No. 1:20-cr-775, ECF No. 49 at 1\u20132 (N.D. Ohio \nSept. 13, 2022) (movant did not receive notice because \nhe had been transferred between federal prisons); \nBrik v.

Ohio Oct. 15, 2024) (movant did not receive \nnotice because he had been transferred first to a \nhalfway house and then to home confinement).  \nSection 2107(c)\u2019s \nreopening \nmechanism \nwas \ndesigned to overcome the problems inherent in \nphysical mail delivery and amplified in the prison \n\n \n39 \n \n \ncontext.  And it worked.  Thanks to \u00a7 2107(c), mail \ndelays and prison-processing problems no longer \ndeprive pro se litigants of their right to appeal.  See \nPet.App.67a\u201368a (Gregory, J., dissenting from denial \nof rehearing en banc) (reopening is \u201cmost commonly, \nif not exclusively, sought by pro se litigants who were \nunable to notice their [appeal on time], often due to no \nfault of their own\u201d); 16A Fed.

(reopening allays \u201cthe plight of th[e] litigant\u201d \nwho \u201cfirst learned of the entry of judgment\u201d too late to \nseek an extension of the appeal period).   \n3. At least, they didn\u2019t until the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nsecond-notice requirement came along.  That new \nmandate sets a \u201ctrap for the unwary,\u201d penalizing the \nsame litigants \u00a7 2107(c) was designed to serve.  \nAverhart, 773 F.2d at 920.  And even the most wary \nmay be unable to avoid its harsh effects. \nThe problem for the unwary is obvious.  \u201cThe idea \nthat the first notice of appeal lapses . . . is not \nintuitive.\u201d  Id.  And experience has proven that \n\u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se litigants, fail to file \n[a] second notice of appeal\u201d even in the face of clear \nrules requiring one.  Fed. R. App. P. 4, Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1993); see also Blanchard v. Frosh, 2024 WL \n4471726 (4th Cir. Oct. 11, 2024) (per curiam) \n(dismissing appeal for failure to file post-reopening \nnotice, despite clear requirement to do so articulated \nin the decision below).  Indeed, even attorneys may \nnot realize that a duplicative notice is required.  Cf. \nLewis v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 850 F.2d 641, 645 (10th \nCir. 1988) (en banc) (explaining that the court\u2019s earlier \npractice of requiring a duplicative notice after Rule \n54(b) certification had \u201coften proved a trap for unwary \nattorneys\u201d).   \n\n \n40 \n \n \nThe short length of the reopening window makes \nthat bad problem worse.  The same mail and prison-\nprocessing delays that warrant reopening in the first \nplace will eat up at least some of the 14-day reopening \nperiod.  See supra 35\u201338; see, e.g., Appellant\u2019s Motion \nfor Extension of Time to Respond at 1, Holston v. \nMora, No. 22-12808 (Feb. 6, 2025) (requesting \nadditional time because pro se appellant did not \nreceive court\u2019s request for briefing until the 13th day \nof 14-day briefing period).  And incarcerated litigants \ncan\u2019t just jump onto Westlaw any time they please.  \nSee 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 543.11(i) (directing that \u201ceach inmate \nshall continue his regular institutional activities \nwithout undue disruption by legal activities\u201d); Ohio \nAdmin. Code R. 5120-9-20(B)(3) (\u201cEach institution \nshall establish a schedule of library hours when legal \nmaterials can be used.\u201d); cf. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. \n343, 351 (1996) (no \u201cfreestanding right to a law \nlibrary\u201d).  So it is anything but reasonable to expect \nthat litigants who receive a reopening order will be \nable to discover the second-notice requirement\u2014and \nget a second notice on file\u2014before the reopening \nwindow closes. \nIndeed, for many of those litigants, the reopening \nclock will run before they even learn that reopening \nhas been granted\u2014making compliance with the \nsecond-notice requirement quite literally impossible.  \nBy definition, every litigant who benefits from \nreopening did not receive notice of an adverse \njudgment within 21 days.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nThe problem should be as obvious as the fact that 14 \nis less than 21:  The same litigants who do not learn \nof an adverse judgment within 21 days may not learn \nof a reopening order within 14 days.  Except this time, \n\n \n41 \n \n \nthere is no further reopening mechanism\u2014or even \nequitable remedy\u2014to save them.  Under Bowles v. \nRussell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), a court can grant \nreopening just once, for just 14 days.  Id. at 213 \n(holding that \u201cCongress specifically limited the \namount of time by which district courts can extend the \nnotice-of-appeal period in \u00a7 2107(c)\u201d).  And once that \n14-day period expires, courts have \u201cno authority to \ncreate equitable exceptions.\u201d  Id.  The upshot is that, \nunder the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule, litigants who do not \nlearn of a reopening order within 14 days lose the \nright to appeal altogether. \nWhat reason could there be for that result?  Again, \n\u00a7 2107(c) authorizes reopening only upon a finding \nthat \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c)(2); see supra 10, 32\u201333.  So requiring \nlitigants to file a second notice of appeal would be \nnothing more than a \u201chollow ritual\u201d of \u201cempty paper \nshuffling\u201d that benefits no one.  N. Am. Specialty, 527 \nF.3d at 1039 (citation omitted).  And the litigants it \npenalizes\u2014people who systematically fail to receive \ntimely notice of court orders\u2014are the very same ones \n\u00a7 2107(c) was designed to protect.   \nIf a statute \u201cis susceptible of two constructions, one \nof which will carry out and the other defeat its \nmanifest object, [it] should receive the former \nconstruction.\u201d  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, \nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 63\u201365 \n(2012) (cleaned up); see also Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 181 (2014) (rejecting reading \nthat would \u201cdefeat the point\u201d of the statute).  That \ncanon could have been written for this case.  This \nCourt has previously rejected constructions of notice-\nof-appeal rules that \u201cplace[ ] pro se litigants in a \n\n \n42 \n \n \nsingularly exacting time bind.\u201d  Becker, 532 U.S. at \n766.  It should do so again here. \nII. THE \nFOURTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nSECOND-NOTICE \nREQUIREMENT \nLACKS \nANY \nSOUND \nJUSTIFICATION. \nThe Fourth Circuit rejected Parrish\u2019s notice of \nappeal for two reasons.  First, it concluded that \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s use of the word \u201creopen\u201d\u2014particularly in \nconjunction with the word \u201cextend\u201d\u2014implicitly \nprecludes notices of appeal from ripening when \nreopening is granted.  Second, it suggested that \nnotices of appeal cease to operate as notices of appeal \nonce they are construed as motions to reopen.  Neither \npoint withstands scrutiny.   \nA.  \u201cReopen\u201d is consistent with ripening. \nNothing about the word \u201creopen\u201d\u2014either on its own \nor in conjunction with the word \u201cextend\u201d\u2014displaces \nthe background ripening principle.  Yes, \u201creopening\u201d \nis often (though not always) granted after the original \nappeal period closes.  But contrary to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s assumption, the ripening principle has never \nhinged on the fiction that the appeal period was \nactually open all along.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nattempt to distinguish \u201creopenings\u201d from \u201cextensions\u201d \non that basis fails, because extensions do not \nnecessarily create a continuous appeal period, either.  \n1. As Parrish\u2019s own case reflects, appeal periods can \n\u201creopen\u201d after having been closed.  See Pet.App.57a \n(recognizing that the ordinary appeal period expired \n60 days after the District Court entered its judgment \non March 24, 2020 (citing Rule 4(a)(1)(B))); Pet.App.5a \n(recognizing that the appeal period was reopened on \nJanuary 8, 2021).  But a prior closure is by no means \n\n \n43 \n \n \nrequired.  Reopening is available when an appellant \ndoes not receive notice within 21 days\u2014which is less \nthan the ordinary time allowed for appeals under \neither \u00a7 2107(a) or \u00a7 2107(b).  That means reopening \ncan be granted either before or after the original \nappeal period expires.   \nBut even assuming, as the Fourth Circuit seemed \nto, that the word \u201creopen\u201d necessarily implies a prior \nclosure, see Pet.App.10a, that in no way precludes \nripening.  Quite the opposite:  Ripening only ever \ncomes into play when a notice of appeal is filed while \nthe appeal period is closed.   \nTake the scenario contemplated by FirsTier and \nRule 4(a)(2), where a notice of appeal is filed after a \ndecision is announced but before an appealable order \nis entered.  See FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2).  No appeal period is open when such a \nnotice is filed.  Nevertheless, the notice ripens when \nthe appeal clock starts ticking.  That is because \u201cthe \ntechnical defect of prematurity\u201d does not \u201cextinguish \n[the] otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at \n273.  It is not because entry of an appealable order \nsomehow rewrites history and retroactively extends \nthe appeal period all the way back to when the notice \nwas first filed.  The appeal clock still started when it \nstarted.  See, e.g., Firchau, 345 F.2d at 271 \n(acknowledging \u201cthe premature filing of th[e] notice\u201d \nbefore entry of final judgment).  \nRule 54(b) certification works the same way.  See \nsupra 26\u201327 (citing cases and noting that courts of \nappeals unanimously recognize ripening in this \ncontext).  A notice of appeal filed before certification \nof an interlocutory order is not filed during any open \n\n \n44 \n \n \nappeal \nperiod. \n \nNevertheless, \na \nsubsequent \ncertification ripens the previously filed notice.  See, \ne.g., Swope, 281 F.3d at 191\u201394.  The notice, in other \nwords, becomes effective once the appeal period opens.  \nNo one pretends that the appeal period actually \nstretched back to the original, uncertified order.  See, \ne.g., Tilden, 596 F.2d at 607 (acknowledging that \u201cthe \nappeal was taken prematurely\u201d before entry of Rule \n54(b) certification).   \nIn these contexts and others, ripening is required \nprecisely because the appeal window was closed when \nthe notice of appeal was filed.  In none of them does \nripening turn on a time traveler\u2019s fiction that the \nwindow was actually open all along.  So even \nassuming the word \u201creopen\u201d implied a prior closure, \nthe ripening principle still applies.  Indeed, the fact \nthat the appeal period was closed when the notice of \nappeal was filed is what sets the stage for the ripening \nin the first place.  \n2. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \n\u201creopening\u201d an appeal period from \u201cextending\u201d it goes \nnowhere for similar reasons.  The two mechanisms\u2019 \nobvious differences account for their different labels.  \nThere is no way to read those labels as implicitly \nincorporating the ripening principle in \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s first \nsentence but displacing it in the second\u2014including \nbecause the Fourth Circuit\u2019s assumption that \nextensions always result in a continuous appeal \nperiod was simply mistaken.   \na. Section 2107(c)\u2019s two sentences create two \ndifferent mechanisms that address two different sets \nof circumstances.  They have different standards:  \nExtensions are warranted \u201cupon a showing of \n\n \n45 \n \n \nexcusable neglect or good cause,\u201d while reopening is \nwarranted when the appellant did not receive notice \nof a judgment \u201cwithin 21 days.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nThey have different deadlines:  Extension motions \nmust be \u201cfiled not later than 30 days after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal,\u201d while reopening motions must be \u201cfiled \nwithin 180 days after entry of the judgment or order \nor within 14 days after receipt of such notice, \nwhichever is earlier.\u201d  Id.  And they authorize \ndifferent relief:  Congress did not impose an outside \nlimit on extensions, see Hamer, 583 U.S. at 24\u201327 \n(holding that \u201cthe statute does not say how long an \nextension may run\u201d and that the 30-day limit in Rule \n4(a)(5)(C) is only a claim-processing rule), while \nreopening is limited to 14 days, see Bowles, 551 U.S. \nat 213 (holding that the 14-day limit is jurisdictional).  \nThese obvious, structural differences between the \ntwo mechanisms more than account for their different \nnames.  Indeed, it would have been strange for \nCongress to have used the same label for both of them.  \n\u201cMotion to reopen\u201d is much clearer\u2014and much \nsimpler\u2014than \u201cmotion to extend the appeal period \nunder \u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s second sentence.\u201d \nTo be sure, the two mechanisms\u2014which appear in \nthe same subsection\u2014also have plenty in common:  \nBoth provide additional time for an appeal; both \nrequire a motion; both afford district courts discretion; \nand both, as explained above (as to reopening) and \nbelow (as to extension), are available before or after \nthe original appeal period expires.  See supra 42\u201343 \n(explaining that reopening is also available before \noriginal appeal period expires); see infra 46\u201348 \n(explaining that extensions are also available after \n\n \n46 \n \n \noriginal \nperiod \nexpires). \n \nAdding \none \nmore \ncommonality to that list\u2014that both incorporate the \nbackground ripening principle\u2014is entirely consistent \nwith the material-variation canon.  That canon \nrecognizes that different terms generally differ along \nat least one axis; it does not require construing \ndifferent terms to be different in every respect.  Cf. \nCity of Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Serv., \nInc., 536 U.S. 424, 435 (2002) (different parts of \nstatute had the same scope \u201cnotwithstanding th[e] \ndifference in verbal formulation\u201d). \nb. In concluding otherwise, the Fourth Circuit \ndoubled down on its fictional-continuity idea, \nsuggesting that the word \u201cextension\u201d implicitly \nincorporates the ripening principle because an \nextension necessarily entails a continuous appeal \nperiod.  Pet.App.9a\u201312a.  As already explained, the \npremise of that argument is wrong:  Ripening does not \nrequire continuity.  See supra Part II.A.1.   \nThe court\u2019s understanding of how extensions work \nwas wrong, too.  The Federal Rules provide that a \ncourt can \u201cextend the time\u201d for complying with a civil \ndeadline not only \u201cbefore the original time . . . expires\u201d \nbut also \u201cafter the time has expired.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 6(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  That is entirely consistent with the \nway extensions work in the real world.  They \nsometimes operate as a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of some \nongoing period.  HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 390.  But \nit is also \u201centirely natural\u2014and consistent with \nordinary usage\u2014to seek an \u2018extension\u2019 of time even \nafter some lapse.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThink of the forgetful student \nwho asks for an \u2018extension\u2019 for a term paper after the \ndeadline has passed, the tenant who does the same \nafter overstaying his lease, or parties who negotiate \n\n \n47 \n \n \nan \u2018extension\u2019 of a contract after its expiration.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, this Court has previously failed to identify \u201ca \nsingle dictionary definition of the term \u2018extension\u2019 \nrequiring unbroken continuity.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Black\u2019s \nLaw Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (defining \u201cextension\u201d \nas \u201c[a] period of additional time to take an action\u201d).  \nSection 2107(c) extensions are no different.  A \nmotion to extend the appeal period can be filed either \nbefore or after the original appeal deadline expires.  \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (authorizing extensions \u201cupon \nmotion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration \nof the time otherwise set for bringing appeal\u201d); see also \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A) (\u201cThe district court may \nextend the time to file a notice of appeal if . . . a party \nso moves no later than 30 days after the time \nprescribed . . . .\u201d). \nThat does not mean that an extension\u2014in this \ncontext, or any other\u2014retroactively extends the \noriginal time allotted all the way through to the new \ndeadline.  This Court recognized exactly that in \nHollyFrontier.  HollyFrontier held that refineries may \nreceive a benefit in Year 1, not receive that benefit in \nYear 2, and then receive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same \nbenefit in Year 3.  594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, \nthe Court rejected the notion that extensions \n\u201coperate[ ] like . . . nunc pro tunc judicial decree[s]\u2014\nretroactively deeming the time originally allotted as \nnow extending continuously to some new and future \ndue date.\u201d  Id. at 392.  An extension may excuse an \notherwise timely filing; but \u201c[i]t cannot change the \nfact that, absent time travel, a lapse or interruption \nhas occurred.\u201d  Id.  \n\n \n48 \n \n \nThe Court even used \u00a7 2107(c) as an example.  \n\u201cUnder certain circumstances,\u201d the Court recognized, \n\u201ca court \u2018may . . . extend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 \neven \u2018after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c)).  \u201cIn other words, the [appeal clock] can \nstart, run, finish, and then restart\u2014because a court \nhas the power to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after \na lapse.\u201d  Id. at 391.  There is no need to pretend \u201cthat \na break in continuity, a lapse, or an interruption never \nhappened.\u201d  Id. at 392.   \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s vision of extensions is exactly \nthe one HollyFrontier rejected.  As even the Fourth \nCircuit acknowledged, notices filed after an appeal \nperiod lapses ripen when an extension is granted.  See \nPet.App.10a\u201312a; Evans, 366 F.2d at 773.  That is not \nbecause extensions make it so that the appeal period \nnever lapsed at all.  It is because pre-extension notices \nof appeal provide adequate notice to all parties, \nconsistent with ordinary ripening principles.  See \nsupra 20\u201324, 33\u201334.  Pre-reopening notices of appeal \nripen for the same reason.   \nB. A filing can be both a notice of appeal \nand a motion to reopen. \nThe Fourth Circuit also made the offhand \nsuggestion that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal could not be \n\u201creconstrue[d]\u201d as a notice of appeal because it \u201cha[d] \nalready been construed\u2014to his benefit\u2014as a motion \n[to reopen].\u201d  Pet.App.3a\u20134a; see id. at 21a (Gregory, \nJ., dissenting) (characterizing this point as a \n\u201cseparate[ ]\u201d justification for the majority\u2019s ruling).  \nThat suggestion was wrong, as a matter of both \nprecedent and principle.   \n\n \n49 \n \n \n1. In Smith, this Court held that an appellate brief \ncould also be construed as a notice of appeal.  502 U.S. \nat 249.  The \u201cFederal Rules,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201cdo \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings.\u201d  Id.  But they \u201cdo \nnot preclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  Id.  A notice of \nappeal, in other words, need not be filed on a separate \npiece of paper that serves no other purpose.  See id.  \n\u201cIf a document filed within the time specified by Rule \n4\u201d affords the requisite notice, \u201cit is effective as a \nnotice of appeal\u201d\u2014regardless of how that document is \nlabeled or what other roles it performs.  Id. at 248\u201349; \nsee supra 20\u201322 (discussing the functional approach \nto notices of appeal). \nThat principle is not limited to appellate briefs.  \nRequests \nfor \ncertificates \nof \nappealability \ncan \nmoonlight as notices of appeal.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 22(b)(2) (\u201cIf no express request for a certificate [of \nappealability] is filed, the notice of appeal constitutes \na request addressed to the judges of the court of \nappeals.\u201d); see, e.g., Clark v. Cartledge, 829 F.3d 303, \n307 n.3 (4th Cir. 2016) (construing a motion for \nextension of time to request a certificate of \nappealability as both a notice of appeal and a request \nfor a certificate of appealability).  Motions to proceed \nin forma pauperis can, too.  See, e.g., Taylor v. Knapp, \n871 F.2d 803, 805 n.1 (9th Cir. 1989) (\u201cThe district \ncourt properly treated Taylor\u2019s motion to proceed on \nappeal in forma pauperis as a notice of appeal[.]\u201d).  \nEven affidavits can suffice.  See, e.g., United States v. \nGibson, 568 F.2d 111, 112 (8th Cir. 1978) (per curiam) \n(construing affidavit accompanying a motion for leave \n\n \n50 \n \n \nto appeal in forma pauperis as a notice of appeal).  In \neach of these contexts, Smith\u2019s reasoning controls.   \nMotions to reopen are no different.  As other courts \nof appeals have recognized, Smith compels the \nconclusion that a single filing can be both a motion to \nreopen and a notice of appeal.  See, e.g., Winters, 88 \nF.4th at 669\u201371 (citing Smith, recognizing that a \nfiling \u201cmay serve more than one function,\u201d and \nconstruing a notice of appeal as a motion to reopen); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 386\u201387 (7th Cir. 2020) \n(citing Smith and rejecting the argument that a \nmotion to reopen \u201ccannot [also] be construed as a \nnotice of appeal\u201d); see also Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062 \n(\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d).   \n2. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s suggestion that Parrish\u2019s \nnotice of appeal ceased operating as a notice of appeal \nonce it was construed as a motion to reopen also flouts \nbasic principles of appellate jurisdiction and civil \nlitigation. \nFor starters, jurisdictional rules come only from \nstatutes.  Hamer, 583 U.S. at 19.  No statute imposes \na separate-document requirement for notices of \nappeal.  And the Federal Rules affirmatively provide \nthat \u201c[a]n appeal must not be dismissed for \ninformality of form or title of the notice of appeal.\u201d  \nFed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7). \nWhat the Rules do require is that a notice of appeal \nleave \u201cno genuine doubt . . . about who is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, [and] to which appellate court.\u201d  \nBecker, 532 U.S. at 767; see also Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(7).  \nParrish\u2019s notice of appeal fits that bill.  It specifies the \n\n \n51 \n \n \nparty taking the appeal and the order to be appealed; \nand there was only one court to which the appeal could \nbe taken.  Pet.App.71a; see Fed. R. App. P. 3(c); Smith, \n502 U.S. at 248.  Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal thus did \nexactly what it needed to do:  It put everyone on notice \nof his intent to appeal.   \nParrish was also acting pro se.  Courts have a duty \nto construe pro se filings generously.  See supra 22; \nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94; Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106; \nHaines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972) (per \ncuriam).  That sometimes means they must \u201cignore \nthe legal label that a pro se litigant attaches to a \nmotion and recharacterize the motion in order to place \nit within a different legal category.\u201d  Castro v. United \nStates, 540 U.S. 375, 381 (2003).  That sort of \nrecharacterization \u201cavoid[s] inappropriately stringent \napplication of formal labeling requirements\u201d and \nensures \u201ccorrespondence between the substance of a \npro se motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis.\u201d  \nId. at 381\u201382; see also Mata v. Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, \n150\u201351 (2015) (recognizing that \u201ccourts sometimes \nconstrue one kind of filing as another\u201d).   \nThe Fourth Circuit abided these principles when it \nconstrued Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion to \nreopen.  Its refusal to also construe his notice of appeal \nas a notice of appeal is exactly the sort of \n\u201cinappropriately stringent application of formal \nlabeling requirements\u201d this Court has consistently \nrejected.  Castro, 540 U.S. at 381. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the decision below and \nremand for the Fourth Circuit to consider Parrish\u2019s \nappeal on the merits. \n \n\n \n52 \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nAmanda R.

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of appeal is best viewed as \n\u201cpremature\u201d to the reopened period, and \u201cthe technical \n\n12 \n \ndefect of prematurity  * * *  should not be allowed to \nextinguish an otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier \nMortg., 498 U.S. at 273; cf. Pet. App. 16a-18a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting) (drawing additional support from cir-\ncuit precedent giving effect to untimely notices of ap-\npeal filed before the time for appeal is extended under \nRule 4(a)(5)). \n2. Although the decision below is incorrect, peti-\ntioner fails to identify any compelling basis for further \nreview, particularly while the Advisory Committee is \nstudying the issue and has the authority to amend the \nrules in a manner that could obviate any need for addi-\ntional guidance from this Court.  See pp. 16-17, infra. \nPetitioner principally contends (Pet. 15-22) that the \ndecision below implicates a division of authority within \nthe courts of appeals, but petitioner overstates the de-\ngree of any such conflict.  District courts have had the \nauthority to reopen the time for appeal under Section \n2107(c) since 1991.  See Pub. L. No. 102-198, \u00a7 12, 105 \nStat. 1627; see also Fed. R. App. 4 advisory committee\u2019s \nnote (1991 Amendment).  But petitioner identifies (Pet. \n17-18) only one other published decision in which a court \nof appeals squarely addressed the jurisdictional ques-\ntion that petitioner seeks to present here.  See Winters \nv. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.) (concluding that a litigant who filed an untimely \nnotice of appeal and then successfully moved for reo-\npening of the appeal period \u201cdid not need to file a new \nnotice of appeal after the district court granted [his] \nmotion to reopen,\u201d under the principle that \u201c[a] notice \nof appeal filed too early, generally speaking, ripens \nwhen the window to appeal begins\u201d) (citing, inter alia, \nFirsTier Mortg., 498 U.S. at 273). \n\n13 \n \nPetitioner also relies (Pet. 18) on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in United States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055 \n(2011), but that case did not expressly resolve the same \njurisdictional issue.  The Ninth Circuit instead per-\nceived the key jurisdictional issue to be whether a pro \nse litigant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal should have been \n\u201cconstrued  * * *  as a motion to reopen\u201d the appeal pe-\nriod.  Id. at 1061.  After concluding that the district \ncourt should have construed the untimely notice as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted the motion, \nthe court of appeals did not then proceed to address \nwhether the pro se litigant needed to file any further \nnotice of appeal during the reopened period.  Id. at \n1061-1062.  The Ninth Circuit instead appears to have \nassumed that its jurisdiction was proper under those \ncircumstances.  See id. at 1062.  While that result is in-\nconsistent with the result reached by the Fourth Circuit \nhere, the precedential force of Withers remains unclear.  \nThis Court does not afford precedential effect to analo-\ngous \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings.\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citi-\nzens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998).   \nAs petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 19-21), the other \ncircuits to have addressed the same jurisdictional ques-\ntion have done so only in unpublished decisions.  See \nHammer v. Bortz, No. 23-1842, 2024 WL 2559204, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 24, 2024); Holden v. Attorney General of \nN.J., No. 21-1862, 2023 WL 8798084, at *1 n.4 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, No. 21-1027, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1. (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022), cert.  \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 454 (2022); Norwood v. East Allen \nCmty. Schs., 825 Fed. Appx. 383, 386-387 (7th Cir. \n2020); United States v. Marshall, 166 F.3d 349, 1998 \nWL 864012, at *2 (10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998) (Tbl.), cert. \n\n14 \n \ndenied, 528 U.S. 861 (1999).2  Those nonprecedential  \ndecisions would not preclude a future panel from reach-\ning a different conclusion and thus do not necessarily \nshow that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent had it arisen in one of those circuits.  And even \ncounting generously, petitioner has identified fewer \nthan ten opinions on point since reopening motions be-\ncame available in 1991.  The paucity of such decisions \nunderscores that the jurisdictional question does not \narise frequently\u2014and when it does, the courts of ap-\npeals have rarely considered it sufficiently important to \nwarrant a published opinion. \n3. In addition to the absence of any substantial con-\nflict, further review is unwarranted because the ques-\ntion presented lacks practical significance.  The ques-\ntion can arise only through an unlikely combination of \nprocedural missteps.  The district court may reopen the \ntime for appeal only if it first finds that a party entitled \nto receive notice of the entry of a judgment or order \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of the entry \nof the judgment or order.  28 U.S.C 2107(c)(1).  But in \nthe era of electronic filing, most litigants now receive \nimmediate notice of orders and judgments.  Petitioner \nemphasizes (Pet. 23) the possibility that pro se litigants \nmay need to rely on notice via the mail, but \u201c[m]any \ncourts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with \nthe court\u2019s permission,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 5 advisory com-\nmittee\u2019s note (2018 Amendment). \n \n2 Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 21) on Farrow is misplaced for the ad-\nditional reason that the litigant in that case simultaneously filed \nboth a motion to reopen the appeal period and a notice of appeal, \nwhile asking the district court to defer entering the notice until after \ngranting reopening.  See 2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1. \n\n15 \n \nMoreover, even with respect to the presumably small \nnumber of litigants who fail to receive the requisite no-\ntice, the question presented only arises if one of those \nlitigants wishes to appeal, the litigant cannot rely on the \ndistrict court\u2019s separate authority to extend the time for \nappeal, and the litigant makes a timely request that the \nappeal period be reopened\u2014but files a notice of appeal \nonly before the reopening, not after.  Notably, Section \n2107(c) imposes an outer limit of 180 days to request re-\nopening.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (court may act upon a \nmotion filed by the \u201cearlier\u201d of the expiration of 180 \ndays from the entry of the judgment or order at issue \nor 14 days after the moving party receives notice).  If \nthat 180-day period expires before the litigant requests \nreopening, the question presented makes no difference \nbecause the district court lacks authority to reopen the \nappeal period in any event.  And even for a timely re-\nquest, the district court cannot reopen the appeal period \nunless it first finds that \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  \n28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(2).  Petitioner does not demonstrate \nthat such a combination of circumstances is likely to oc-\ncur frequently, and the limited number of appellate deci-\nsions addressing the question presented suggests it does \nnot.  Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own prior court-appointed \ncounsel cited the \u201cthe relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to\u201d as one \nreason for declining to file a petition for rehearing en \nbanc on petitioner\u2019s behalf.  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2. \nPetitioner also overstates (Pet. 22) the practical sig-\nnificance of the decision below within the Fourth Circuit \nitself.  Although the decision below is incorrect, it estab-\nlishes a clear and easily applied jurisdictional rule going \nforward.  District courts in the Fourth Circuit may now \nadvise pro se litigants of the need to file a new notice of \n\n16 \n \nappeal in cases in which a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod is granted.  And although petitioner derides the \nfiling of a second notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod of appeal as a \u201chollow ritual,\u201d Pet. 30 (citation \nomitted), he does not show that filing a second notice \nwill be particularly difficult for most or indeed any liti-\ngants affected by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. \n4. This Court\u2019s review is also unwarranted at the \npresent time because the Advisory Committee has al-\nready taken steps to study whether changes to Rule 4(a) \nmay be warranted.  In Winters, the Sixth Circuit ob-\nserved that the Advisory Committee is \u201ccharge[d]  * * *  \nto review issues of precisely this sort\u201d and has the au-\nthority to \u201cimprov[e] the rules where needed.\u201d  88 F.4th \nat 672.  The Sixth Circuit further observed that the Ad-\nvisory Committee \u201cmay be a profitable next stage for \nthis debate,\u201d ibid.\u2014a sentiment endorsed by the dis-\nsenting judges in this case, see Pet. App. 68a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). \nOn October 9, 2024, after the filing of the petition for \na writ of certiorari in this case, the Advisory Committee \nvoted to form a subcommittee to address the issues \nraised by the Sixth Circuit in Winters and the Fourth \nCircuit in the decision below.  See Memorandum from \nEdward Hartnett to the Advisory Committee on the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, New Suggestion \nfrom Judge Sutton 1-3 (Sept. 5, 2024), reprinted in Ad-\nvisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Tab 7A, at 292-\n295 (Oct. 9, 2024) (reporter\u2019s memorandum describing \nWinters and this case and proposing a subcommittee); \nsee also Jacqueline Thomsen, Administrative Stays \nChanges Weighed After Justices\u2019 Criticism, Bloomberg \nLaw News (Oct. 10, 2024) (noting that the Advisory \nCommittee agreed to \u201clook into the rule on reopening \n\n17 \n \nthe time to file an appeal\u201d in light of Chief Judge Sut-\nton\u2019s suggestion). \nBecause the relevant provisions in Rule 4(a)(6) may \nwell change as a result of the rulemaking process, the \nquestion whether the current language of the rule sup-\nports petitioner may be of limited prospective im-\nportance.  And the Advisory Committee is fully capable \nof addressing the policy concerns that petitioner raises \nhere.  See Pet. 22-27. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \nBRIAN M.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1. On April 7, 2017, Parrish drafted and signed a \nfederal complaint seeking compensation for the years \nhe wrongfully spent in administrative segregation and \ndelivered that complaint for mailing.  JA16\u201325, 132\u2013\n34.  The District Court received his complaint and \ndeemed it filed on May 3, 2017.  JA25. \nAfter multiple rounds of briefing, the District Court \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an opinion and order dated \nMarch 23, 2020 and a judgment dated March 24, 2020.  \nPet.App.55a, 57a, 59a.  Both documents were mailed \nto the federal prison in Illinois where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But \nunbeknownst to the court, Parrish was in the process \nof being transferred from federal to state custody.  Id.; \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address) (Apr. \n14, 2020).  As a result, Parrish did not receive notice \nof the judgment against him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat \nthe earliest,\u201d Pet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its \nentry and long after the time to file a notice of appeal \nhad expired, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted promptly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  Within 14 days of receiving \nnotice of the judgment, he filed a document entitled \n\u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; see D.Ct. Dkt. No. \n131-1 (notice of appeal envelope).  In that document, \nParrish explained the reason for his delay:  \u201cDue to my \nbeing transferred from Federal to State custody I did \nnot receive this order until June 25, 2020.  It is now \n7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of appeal.\u201d  \nPet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit construed that filing \nas a motion to reopen the appeal period under Rule \n\n13 \n \n4(a)(6) and remanded for the District Court to rule on \nthe motion.  Id. at 56a\u201358a. \nThe District Court found that Parrish had received \nnotice of the judgment more than 21 days after its \nentry, that he had moved for reopening within 14 days \nof receiving notice, and that no party would be \nprejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at 61a \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  It therefore reopened \nthe appeal period for 14 days.  Id. at 61a\u201362a.  It \nfurther directed the clerk to \u201csupplement th[e] Court\u2019s \nrecord accordingly, and transmit the same to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a. \n3. The case then returned to the Fourth Circuit.  \nThere, both Parrish and the Government agreed that \nParrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had become effective \nin light of the reopened appeal period.  See Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) at 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 \n(U.S. Br.) at 1. \nThe Fourth Circuit disagreed.  A divided panel \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, \nholding that he had \u201cnot file[d] a timely notice of \nappeal.\u201d  Pet.App.2a.  In so doing, the panel majority \nrecognized that the District Court had properly \nreopened the appeal period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6).  Id. at 4a\u20135a.  It reasoned, however, \nthat Parrish was required to file a new notice of appeal \nwithin the reopened appeal period\u2014i.e., 14 days from \nthe District Court\u2019s order.  Id. at 12a\u201313a.  And it \nrejected Parrish\u2019s argument \u201cthat when the district \ncourt reopened the time to appeal . . . , it \u2018validated\u2019 his \nprior untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 5a\u20136a.  \nAlthough the panel majority agreed that earlier-filed \n\n14 \n \nnotices of appeal can ripen when a district court grants \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension motion, the panel rejected \nthat principle for Rule 4(a)(6) reopening motions.  \nAccording to the panel, \u201creopening\u201d is different from \n\u201cextending.\u201d  Id. at 6a, 9a\u201312a.  Moreover, \u201cParrish\u2019s \nearlier filing ha[d] already been construed\u201d as a \nmotion to reopen and, in the majority\u2019s view, could not \nalso serve as a notice of appeal.  Id. at 3a\u20134a. \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He would \nhave held that Parrish\u2019s initial, pre-reopening notice \nof appeal sufficed to confer jurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s \nappeal.  Id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory pointed \nout that the Courts of Appeals consistently hold \u201cthat \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension retroactively validates an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And in \nJudge Gregory\u2019s view, the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted \ndistinction\u201d between reopening and extending an \nappeal period \u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. \nat 20a.  He also rejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s July 2020 filing cannot simultaneously \nserve as both a notice of appeal and a motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  In response, the Government agreed with \nParrish that the panel had erred in holding that it \nlacked jurisdiction.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, 12.  As \na result, the Government took \u201cno position with \nrespect to Parrish\u2019s request for panel rehearing.\u201d  Id. \nat 2.  But it opposed rehearing en banc on the ground \nthat, in its view, this issue was not \u201csufficiently \nimportant to warrant the intervention of the en banc \ncourt.\u201d  Id. \n\n15 \n \nThe panel denied rehearing over Judge Gregory\u2019s \ndissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the Fourth Circuit \ndenied rehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Id. at 63a\u2013\n64a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a statement in support of \nthe en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u201367a.  Judge Gregory, \njoined by three other judges, wrote a dissent.  Id. at \n67a\u201369a. \n\u201cAt its core,\u201d the dissenters explained, \u201cthis case \nrequires us to determine whether access to [appellate \ncourts] should be foreclosed for failure to refile a notice \nof appeal during the newly reopened period following \nsuccess under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a.  That issue, \nthe dissenters recognized, has \u201csplit\u201d \u201ccircuit courts \nand judges.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  And it is a question of \n\u201cexceptional \nimportance,\u201d \nincluding \nbecause \nit \ndisproportionately harms \u201cpopulations who may not \nbe \nable \nto \nconsistently \naccess \ninformation \nelectronically\u201d and has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects.\u201d  Id. at 68a\u201369a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThe Courts of Appeals are divided on the recurring \nquestion whether a notice of appeal filed before an \nappeal period is reopened becomes sufficient once a \ndistrict court reopens the appeal period, or whether a \nnew and duplicative notice of appeal is required after \nreopening.  This issue is profoundly important to the \npro se litigants it most frequently affects.  The decision \nbelow is wrong.  And this case is an excellent vehicle.  \nCertiorari should be granted. \nI. \nTHE COURTS OF APPEALS ARE DIVIDED. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit held that \na litigant must file a new notice of appeal after a \ndistrict court reopens the time to appeal under Rule \n\n16 \n \n4(a)(6).  Five Courts of Appeals disagree and hold that \na previously filed notice of appeal ripens once a Rule \n4(a)(6) motion is granted.  That split is entrenched:  \nThe Fourth Circuit has declined to reconsider its \nposition en banc, and three other circuits have \nacknowledged the split and adhered to their positions \nsince the panel\u2019s decision below. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Requires a New, Post-\nReopening Notice of Appeal. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit dismissed \nParrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did \nnot file a new notice of appeal after the District Court \nreopened the appeal period.  Pet.App.1a; see supra, at \n13\u201314.  In so doing, the court held that an order \ngranting a motion to reopen under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) does not \u201cvalidate [an] earlier filed \nuntimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.10a; see id. at 5a\u2013\n6a.  It further reasoned that a single filing cannot \nsimultaneously serve as a motion to reopen and a \nnotice of appeal.  See id. at 3a\u20134a.  Accordingly, \nlitigants in the Fourth Circuit who file a notice of \nappeal before a motion to reopen is granted must file \na second, duplicative notice within 14 days of the \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order to pursue an appeal.  \nId. at 12a\u201313a. \nAlthough the decision below recognized that a prior \nFourth Circuit panel had accepted jurisdiction based \non a pre-reopening notice of appeal, the court \ndefinitively rejected that position.  Id. at 12a \n(discussing Grant v. City of Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x 236 \n(4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam)).  \u201cThis unpublished \ndecision,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdoes not, in its one short \nparagraph, conduct any analysis of the Rule 4(a)(6) \n\n17 \n \nissue\u201d and \u201chardly constitutes binding, persuasive \nauthority.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the prior decision itself \ndisclaimed any precedential value.  Grant, 810 F. \nApp\u2019x at 236 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not binding \nprecedent in this circuit.\u201d). \nThe decision below thus reflects the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndefinitive answer to the Question Presented.  And the \nFourth Circuit declined to reconsider its position en \nbanc\u2014despite the parties\u2019 agreement that the panel \nhad erred, despite a dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc, and despite its recognition of the \ncircuit split.  See supra, at 14\u201315.  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nposition is thus deeply entrenched. \nB. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits Do Not Require a New, \nPost-Reopening Notice of Appeal.  \nThe Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth \nCircuits disagree with the Fourth Circuit and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants reopening under Rule 4(a)(6).  In \nthose jurisdictions, Parrish\u2019s appeal would have been \nheard on the merits. \n1. In Winters v. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. \n2023), the Sixth Circuit held that an appellant who \nfiles a notice of appeal prior to a reopening order does \nnot need to file a second, post-reopening notice of \nappeal.  The facts of that case are substantively \nindistinguishable from the facts of this one.  Like \nParrish, Winters was a pro se inmate who did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment because \nhe had been moved from one correctional facility to \nanother.  Id. at 667.  Like Parrish, Winters promptly \nfiled a notice of appeal that was treated as a motion to \n\n18 \n \nreopen.  See id. at 668.  And like Parrish, Winters did \nnot file a new notice of appeal within 14 days after the \norder reopening the appeal period.  See id. \nBut unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held \nthat \u201cWinters did not need to file a new notice of \nappeal after the district court granted the motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id at 671.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit \nrecognized that \u201cthe courts of appeal are not all in tune \non these issues.\u201d  Id. at 672 (citing, inter alia, the \ndecision below).  And it rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nanalysis at every turn.  A premature notice, the court \nreasoned, \u201cripens when the window to appeal \nbegins\u201d\u2014no matter whether the event triggering the \nappeal period is the entry of final judgment, Rule 54(b) \ncertification, or Rule 4(a)(6) reopening.  Id. at 671 \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2) (final judgment), and \nGood v. Ohio Edison Co., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. \n1997) (Rule 54(b) certification)).  And \u201ca single \npleading may serve more than one function\u2014for \nexample, . . . a notice of appeal may serve as a motion \nfor an extension of time.\u201d  Id. at 669\u201370 (citing Smith \nv. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 249 (1992)). \n2. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in \nUnited States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th \nCir. 2011).  Like Parrish and Winters, Withers\u2014\nanother pro se inmate\u2014filed an untimely notice of \nappeal.  See id.  And like Parrish and Winters, Withers \nexplained in his notice that he received the judgment \nonly after the initial appeal period had expired.  See \nid.  The Ninth Circuit held that the district court \nshould have construed Withers\u2019 notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted it.  Id.  It \nfurther held that the pre-reopening notice of appeal \nwas sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.  See id.  \n\n19 \n \n3. The Third, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have \nendorsed the same rule, albeit in unpublished \ndecisions. \na. In Holden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 \n(3d Cir. Dec. 20, 2023), the Third Circuit considered an \nappeal in the same mold as Parrish\u2019s, Winters\u2019, and \nWithers\u2019:  A pro se inmate received notice of a \njudgment \nafter \nthe \ntime \nto \nappeal \nexpired, \nimmediately filed a document captioned \u201cnotice of \nappeal,\u201d was granted reopening under Rule 4(a)(6), \nand did not file a new notice of appeal during the 14-\nday reopening period.  See id. at *1, n.4.  The Third \nCircuit recognized that the \u201cappeal [was] timely, and \n[that] [it] ha[d] jurisdiction,\u201d notwithstanding the \nabsence of a post-reopening notice of appeal.  Id. \nb. The Seventh Circuit has addressed this issue \nboth before and after the decision below.  First, in \nNorwood v. East Allen County Schools, 825 F. App\u2019x \n383 (7th Cir. 2020), the appellant\u2014a school teacher \nacting pro se\u2014filed a notice titled \u201cBelated Appeal\u201d \nthat explained he had not received timely notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 386.  The district court \nconstrued the notice as a motion to reopen and granted \nit, finding no evidence that the teacher had been \nserved with the judgment.  See Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., No. 15-cv-249, Dkt. No. 196, at 3 (N.D. \nInd. Feb. 26, 2019).  The teacher did not file a new \nnotice of appeal during the 14-day reopening period.  \n825 F. App\u2019x at 386.  But the Seventh Circuit held that \nthe teacher\u2019s initial notice had become effective when \nthe appeal period was reopened.  Id.  \u201cThat [he] filed it \nbefore the judge reopened the window to appeal\u201d did \nnot \u201caffect its timeliness,\u201d the court reasoned, because \n\u201ca prematurely filed notice of appeal becomes effective \n\n20 \n \nafter the district court enters the order that opens the \ntime to appeal.\u201d  Id. at 387. \nIn Hammer v. Bortz, 2024 WL 2559204 (7th Cir. \nMay 24, 2024), the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the \ncircuit split created by the decision below but adhered \nto its position.  See id. at *3.  The appellant\u2014a pro se \ninmate\u2014learned of the judgment against him only \nafter inquiring about the status of his case.  Id. at *2.  \nAnd he filed a notice of appeal accompanied by a \ndeclaration explaining that he had only just received \nuntimely notice of the adverse judgment.  See id.  The \nSeventh Circuit construed that filing as a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion, and the district court granted it.  Id.  Although \n\u201cHammer did not file a new notice of appeal\u201d during \nthe 14-day reopening period, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat his initial notice \u201cbecame effective\u201d \u201cwhen the \njudge accepted [his] explanation and granted the \nmotion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at *3. \nIn so holding, the Seventh Circuit observed that \n\u201c[o]ther circuits that have addressed this question \nhave reached divergent conclusions on whether the \nfailure to file a new notice of appeal after the time is \nreopened deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction.\u201d  \nId. (citing the decision below and Winters, 88 F.4th at \n671).  Recognizing that its prior \u201cpractice ha[d] aligned \nwith the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\u201d\u2014not the Fourth\u2019s\u2014the court \nagain held that \u201ca second notice of appeal within the \nreopened window for appeal\u201d is not required.  Id. \nc. The Tenth Circuit reached the same result in both \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998), and Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022).  In \nMarshall, a pro se inmate filed a late notice of appeal \n\n21 \n \nafter notice of a judgment against him was mailed to \nthe wrong prison.  See 1998 WL 864012, at *2.  The \ndistrict court then granted his motion to reopen the \nappeal period.  See id.  Relying on circuit precedent \naddressing Rule 4(a)(5) motions, the Tenth Circuit \nheld that \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of a Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(6) motion validates a notice of appeal filed prior \nto the entry of such an order.\u201d  Id. (footnote omitted)).  \nIn the Rule 4(a)(6) context, just as in the Rule 4(a)(5) \ncontext, \u201cto require the filing of a new notice of appeal \nwould amount to little more than empty paper \nshuffling.\u201d  Id. (quoting Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 \nF.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nSimilarly, in Farrow, the appellant\u2014yet another \npro se inmate\u2014filed a notice of appeal at the same \ntime as a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen, asking the \ncourt \u201cto process the notice once it had addressed his \nmotion.\u201d  2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1.  He never filed a \nsecond notice after the motion to reopen was granted.  \nBut the Tenth Circuit held that the previously filed \nnotice \nof \nappeal \n\u201cbecame \neffective, \nconferring \n[appellate] jurisdiction\u201d when the appeal period was \nreopened.  Id. \n* \n* \n* \nThe circuits are thus openly divided about whether \nthey have jurisdiction to hear appeals like Parrish\u2019s.  \nHad Parrish been incarcerated in the Third, Sixth, \nSeventh, Ninth, or Tenth Circuits, his appeal would \nhave been decided on its merits.  But because he was \nincarcerated in the Fourth Circuit, his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Courts on both sides \nof the split have acknowledged the division of \nauthority, and the Fourth Circuit has refused to \n\n22 \n \nreconsider its outlier position.  Only this Court can \nrestore uniformity. \nII. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT. \nThe division of authority on the Question Presented \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  This issue recurs even \nmore frequently than the decisions above suggest.  \nAnd when it does arise, it is outcome-determinative of \na litigant\u2019s right to appeal. \n1.a. Courts encounter cases like Parrish\u2019s all the \ntime.  In just one week in December 2023, for example, \nthe Third Circuit and the Sixth Circuit both issued \ndecisions holding that a duplicative notice of appeal is \nnot required.  See Winters, 88 F.4th 665 (6th Cir. Dec. \n15, 2023); Holden, 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. Dec. 20, \n2023).  The Fourth Circuit was considering Parrish\u2019s \nen banc petition during the same time.  And in June \n2024, the Fourth Circuit dismissed at least three \nappeals in the same posture as Parrish\u2019s.  See Sparks \nv. Russell, 2024 WL 2862119 (4th Cir. June 6, 2024); \nHammond v. Burns, 2024 WL 3102794 (4th Cir. June \n24, 2024) (consolidating and dismissing two appeals). \nThose cases, moreover, are just the tip of the \niceberg.  Although the Question Presented is \njurisdictional, its answer is often undisputed by the \nparties.  See, e.g., Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1 \n(agreeing that no second notice was required).  As a \nresult, courts frequently proceed to the merits without \ndiscussing the potential problem.  See, e.g., Dec v. \nPennsylvania, 2024 WL 3338301 (3d Cir. July 9, 2024); \nMcKenzie v. Wolfe, 2024 WL 399104 (4th Cir. Feb. 2, \n2024).  That means that the outcome of substantively \nidentical appeals can turn not only on the circuit in \nwhich each appeal is filed but also on the \n\n23 \n \nhappenstance of whether each panel happens to notice \nthe potential jurisdictional flaw.  It also means that \nthe Question Presented almost certainly arises in \nmany more cases than the opinions addressing it \nreflect. \nb. That should come as no surprise.  Last year, pro \nse litigants filed nearly half of all notices of appeal.  \nSee 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 9 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2023), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/\n2023year-endreport.pdf.  And close to 90% of prisoner \nappeals were filed pro se.  Id. \nPro se litigants are exponentially more likely to \nreceive untimely notice of a judgment than counseled \nparties.  Whereas attorneys receive immediate notice \nthrough electronic case-filing systems, pro se litigants \nreceive notice by snail mail.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n77(d)(1) (requiring clerk to notify parties of orders and \njudgments as provided by Rule 5(b), which provides for \nservice by mail upon pro se litigants).  Unlike \nelectronic notifications, mail often gets delayed in \ntransit.  See U.S. Postal Serv., Analysis of FY 2023 \nPerformance \n31 \n(2024), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2803_2\n804%20Report_Final.pdf (\u201cIn FY 2023, the Postal \nService failed to meet six out of its eight targets for\u201d \nfirst-class mail products, including late delivery of \nnearly 20 percent of mail meant to be delivered within \nthree to five days); U.S. Postal Serv. Office of Inspector \nGeneral, Spring 2024 Semiannual Report to Congress \n17 (2024), available at https://www.uspsoig.gov/\nsites/default/files/reports/2024-05/FY2024_Spring\n_SARC.pdf (reporting problems with timely mail \ndelivery in 95% of audited locations).  And unlike \n\n24 \n \nemail addresses, physical addresses do not follow \npeople around when they move\u2014which can cause \ndelivery failures and forwarding delays.  See, e.g., \nAcosta v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, 2021 WL \n5395997, \nat \n*3 \n(N.D. \nTex. \n2021) \n(discussing \ndocumentation of USPS mail forwarding delays of up \nto 10 days); Gallegos-Lopez v. Kansas City, 2009 WL \n2912637, at *2 (D. Kan. Sept. 9, 2009) (USPS failed to \ntimely forward EEOC\u2019s right-to-sue letter to new \naddress); Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., dissenting) (\u201cRule \n4(a)(6) is usually invoked under circumstances where \na party relocates, is relocated, or is otherwise unable \nto receive mail at the address listed with the court.\u201d). \nPro se prisoners face even more serious obstacles to \nobtaining timely notice\u2014and have less power to \nmitigate them.  See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, \n270\u201372 (1988) (pointing out pro se prisoners\u2019 lack of \ncontrol over outgoing mail); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49, Adv. \nComm. Notes (2018 Amendment) (recognizing that \n\u201cincarcerated individuals . . . often lack reliable access \nto the internet or email\u201d).  Prison mail systems are \nnotoriously slow.  See Advisory Comm. on Appellate \nRules, Agenda for Fall 2016 Meeting 163 (2016), \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2016-10-\nappellate-agenda-book_0.pdf \n(reporter\u2019s \nmemorandum identifying recurring legal questions \narising from \u201cdelay by prison authorities in delivering\u201d \ncourt orders to prisoners); Dallas Morning News, Mail \nDelays \nFrustrate \nPrisoners \n(Nov. \n12, \n2023) \n(documenting delays of three weeks to two months in \nTexas prisons\u2019 mail processing); Penton v. Johnson, \n2023 WL 7121407, at *2\u20133 (9th Cir. Oct. 30, 2023) \n(denying qualified immunity to prison officials who \nfailed to forward a transferred prisoner\u2019s mail \u201cfor over \n\n25 \n \nseven months\u201d).  And prisoners are often moved \nbetween facilities without notice.  See U.S. Marshals \nServs. Office of Pub. Affairs, Fact Sheet: Prisoner \nTransportation, \nhttps://www.usmarshals.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/media/document/2024-Prisoner-\nTransportation.pdf (reporting nearly a quarter million \nprisoner movements by the Marshals Service in FY \n2023, at an average pace of almost 1,000 prisoner \nmovements each day); Grandison v. Moore, 786 F.2d \n146, 149 (3d Cir. 1986) (\u201cPrisoners . . . have no control \nover their whereabouts, and may be temporarily \ntransferred out of the prison for court proceedings or \nplaced in administrative or punitive segregation which \ncan delay mail delivery.\u201d); see, e.g., Pet.App.60a\u201361a; \nWinters, 88 F.4th at 671.  Indeed, Mr. Parrish has been \nheld in three different institutions just this calendar \nyear. \nWith tens of thousands of pro se appeals filed each \nyear, even a low rate of mail-delivery delay or failure \nproduces a meaningful number of cases where a \nlitigant must rely on Rule 4(a)(6) for the chance to \nappeal. \nc. Pro se litigants who belatedly receive an adverse \njudgment often attempt to salvage an appeal in one of \ntwo ways.  Many litigants file a notice of appeal that \ncontains an explanation for their delay.  See, e.g., \nPet.App.71a; Winters, 88 F.4th at 668; Withers, 638 \nF.3d at 1061.  Courts must construe pro se filings \ngenerously, see Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 \n(2007) (per curiam), so such notices are construed as \nRule 4(a)(6) motions.  See Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062.  \nOther litigants file a notice of appeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion simultaneously.  See, e.g., Farrow, 2022 WL \n274489, at *1 n.1.  The upshot in either case is the \n\n26 \n \nsame:  Litigants who try to appeal and explain the \ncircumstances as soon as they learn of the judgment \nagainst them may receive relief in the form of a \nreopened appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6). \nBut some pro se litigants will have no meaningful \nopportunity to file a second notice of appeal within the \n14-day reopening window.  Every litigant who benefits \nfrom Rule 4(a)(6), by definition, previously failed to \nreceive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A).  And if \nsuch a litigant does not receive notice of the reopening \norder before the 14-day window closes, he cannot \npossibly file a second notice of appeal on time. \nEven when litigants do promptly learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened, it may not even \noccur to them that a second notice of appeal might be \nrequired.  The Rules Advisory Committee has long \nrecognized that \u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se \nlitigants, fail to file [a] second notice of appeal.\u201d  Adv. \nComm. Notes (1993 Amendment).  And who could \nblame them, given that courts often affirmatively \ninform litigants that they need not file a duplicative \nnotice.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Lamanna, 2021 WL \n1759924, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2021) (\u201cPlaintiff need \nnot file a new notice of appeal.\u201d); Jacoby v. Thomas, \n2019 WL 3226896, at *3 (M.D. Ala. July 17, 2019) \n(\u201c[Plaintiff] is not required to file a new notice of \nappeal.\u201d); Brown v. United States, 2010 WL 376922, at \n*1 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2010) (previously filed notice of \nappeal \u201cshall be deemed timely filed\u201d upon reopening \nof appeal period).  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit initially \nsuggested as much in this very case.  See Pet.App.58a \n(\u201cThe record, as supplemented, will be returned to this \ncourt for further consideration.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \n2. In addition to recurring frequently, the Question \nPresented also has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those it \naffects.\u201d  Pet.App.69a (Gregory, J., dissenting).  That \nis because a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional \nrequirement.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214.  This Court \nhas already held that an appeal must be dismissed if \na notice of appeal is filed after the 14-day reopening \nperiod has expired.  See id. at 207\u201309.  And neither 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107 nor the Federal Rules authorizes courts \nto extend or reopen the reopening window under any \ncircumstances.  See id. at 214 (\u201cCourt[s] ha[ve] no \nauthority to create equitable exceptions[.]\u201d). \nAs a result, litigants who do not learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened (or that a second \nnotice is required) until after the 14-day window has \nclosed are left with no possibility of recourse.  That is \ntrue no matter the strength of their appellate \narguments or how inequitable that result might be. \nThe harsh consequences of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule \nare particularly troubling given the population this \nissue \u201cmost commonly\u201d affects: \u201cpro se litigants who \nwere unable to notice their intent to seek [appellate] \nreview during the statutory appeals period, often due \nto no fault of their own.\u201d  Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., \ndissenting).  These litigants are disproportionately \n\u201celderly, \nunhoused, \ndetained, \nimprisoned, \n. . . \ndifferently abled,\u201d or otherwise unable \u201cto consistently \naccess information electronically.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s rule thus \u201crequire[s] more of those \nwho have less.\u201d  Id. at 69a. \n \n\n28 \n \nIII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S POSITION IS WRONG. \nAs the Government recognized below, see Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 84, at 2, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s minority rule is \nalso simply wrong.  Like other premature notices of \nappeal, notices of appeal filed before the appeal period \nis reopened become effective once a motion to reopen \nis granted.  The use of the word \u201creopen\u201d in Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) does not justify a different \nresult.  And there is no reason why a notice of appeal \ncannot serve two functions at once. \n1.a. Unlike filing a notice of appeal too late, filing a \nnotice of appeal too early does not \u201cextinguish an \notherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  \nThat principle\u2014sometimes called the doctrine of \n\u201ccumulative finality,\u201d see generally Bryan Lammon, \nCumulative Finality, 52 GA. L. REV. 767 (2018)\u2014\nfollows from this Court\u2019s functional approach to \nnotices of appeal.  See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. \n757, 767 (2001) (holding that a notice suffices so long \nas there is \u201cno genuine doubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, to which appellate court\u201d).  \nTaking that same functional approach, the Courts of \nAppeals have long held that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal becomes procedurally \nproper.  See, e.g., Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d \nCir. 1975) (notice filed after announcement of a \ndecision but before the entry of judgment); Firchau v. \nDiamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269, 271 (9th Cir. 1965) \n(notice filed after dismissal of a complaint but before \ndismissal of the entire action); Bryant v. Elliott, 467 \nF.2d 1109,1109 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (notice \nfiled after expiration of the appeal period but before \nextension was granted).  And this Court expressly \nendorsed the ripening principle in FirsTier.  See 498 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. at 274 (\u201cconclud[ing] that Rule 4(a)(2) permits a \nnotice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to \nserve as an effective notice from a subsequently \nentered final judgment\u201d). \nThe ripening principle is also reflected in the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  It appears in \nRule 4(a)(2), which provides that \u201c[a] notice of appeal \nfiled after the court announces a decision or order\u2014\nbut before the entry of the judgment or order\u2014is \ntreated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\u201d  It \nis reflected in Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(i), which provides that \u201ca \nnotice of appeal\u201d filed \u201cafter the court announces or \nenters a judgment\u2014but before it disposes of [certain] \nmotion[s] listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014 . . . becomes \neffective . . . when the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion is entered.\u201d  And it appears in an \nanalogous provision for criminal appeals, too.  See \nRule 4(b)(2).  These provisions were added to the \nFederal Rules in 1979 in \u201crecogni[tion]\u201d of the pre-\nexisting consensus among the Courts of Appeals that \n\u201cpremature appeals\u201d are \u201ceffective.\u201d  Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1979 Amendment). \nConsistent with that broader principle and this \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in FirsTier, the Courts of Appeals \nconsistently hold that prematurely filed notices of \nappeal ripen not only in the circumstances covered by \nRules 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(4)(B)(i), but also in contexts not \naddressed by those provisions.  Most notably, the \nCourts of Appeals uniformly recognize that a notice of \nappeal filed before a needed Rule 54(b) certification \nripens once that certification is obtained\u2014even though \nRule 4 does not expressly provide for ripening in that \nsituation.  See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, \n1184\u201385 (1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); Tilden Fin. \n\n30 \n \nCorp. v. Palo Tire Serv., Inc., 596 F.2d 604, 607 (3d Cir. \n1979); Good, 104 F.3d at 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n \nof Bds. of Pharm. v. Bd. of Regents, 633 F.3d 1297, \n1307 (11th Cir. 2011); State Contracting & Eng\u2019g Corp. \nv. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1334\u201335 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \nb. The same principle\u2014that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal period opens\u2014controls \nhere, too.  That result follows directly from this Court\u2019s \nholding in FirsTier.  And it is consistent with the way \npremature notices of appeal are treated in other \ncontexts.   \nIt is also consistent with the functional approach to \nnotices of appeal, because a second, post-reopening \nnotice of appeal serves no conceivable purpose.  Once \nthe initial notice is filed, there can be \u201cno genuine \ndoubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, from what judgment, \nto which appellate court\u201d in this context.  Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767.  If anything, a notice of appeal filed before \nRule 4(a)(6) reopening gives the appellee more notice \nof the coming appeal than one filed after reopening.  \nAnd an appellee will never be prejudiced when an \nappeal proceeds based on the premature notice, \nbecause Rule 4(a)(6) reopening is available only if the \ndistrict court finds that no prejudice will flow from \nreopening.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6)(C). \n \nAccordingly, \na \nsecond-notice \nrequirement would be a \u201chollow ritual\u201d that amounts \nto nothing more than \u201cpaper shuffling.\u201d  Hinton, 997 \nF.3d at 778 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd at what cost.  It would create a trap for unwary \npro se litigants.  See supra, at 23\u201327.  And even where \npro se litigants do manage to spot the tripwire, it \nwould still leave some litigants in the lurch through no \n\n31 \n \nfault of their own, because litigants eligible for relief \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) may not even learn of an order \ngranting a motion to reopen until after the 14-day \nreopening period expires.  After all, they necessarily \ndid not learn of a judgment within a longer 21-day \nperiod.  See supra, at 26. \n2. The Fourth Circuit did not even cite FirsTier.  \nAnd it offered no justification for deviating from the \nbackground presumption of cumulative finality.  \nInstead, it relied on an untenable distinction between \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) and \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).  According to the Fourth Circuit, \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) contemplates an \nunbroken period from the entry of the appealable \norder to the end of the extended appeal period.  \nPet.App.9a\u201312a.  That continuity, it reasoned, is what \nallows a premature notice of appeal to ripen when a \nRule 4(a)(5) extension motion is granted.  Id.  By \ncontrast, the Fourth Circuit insisted that \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) creates a new, noncontiguous \nappeal period.  Id. at 9a\u201310a.  As a result, it concluded \nthat a premature notice of appeal does not ripen when \na Rule 4(a)(6) motion is granted.  See id. \nBoth premises underlying that analysis are wrong.   \na. The first faulty premise is that an extension \nunder Rule 4(a)(5)\u2014unlike reopening under Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014necessarily involves an unbroken appeal \nperiod.  By the plain terms of \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(5), a motion for an extension can be filed up to 30 \ndays after the appeal period has lapsed.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).  Indeed, this Court \nrecently cited Rule 4(a)(5) extension motions as an \nexample of extensions that do not necessarily involve \n\n32 \n \na continuous period of time.  In HollyFrontier, the \nCourt held that refineries may receive a benefit in \nYear 1, not receive that benefit in Year 2, and then \nreceive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same benefit in Year 3.  \n594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, it relied on an \nanalogy to Rule (4)(a)(5) extensions.  \u201cUnder certain \ncircumstances,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca court \u2018may . . . \nextend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 even \u2018after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)).  \n\u201cIn other words, the timer can start, run, finish, and \nthen restart\u201d\u2014precisely \u201cbecause a court has the \npower to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after a lapse.\u201d  \nId. at 391. \nHollyFrontier \nthus \nexpressly \nrejected \nthe \nproposition that extensions always \u201cretroactively \ndeem[] the time originally allotted as now extending \ncontinuously to some new and future due date.\u201d  Id. at \n392.  Indeed, the Court recognized that when Congress \nwants to retroactively create continuity via an \nextension, it says so\u2014including by using modifiers like \n\u201cconsecutive\u201d or \u201csuccessive.\u201d  See id.  And Congress \nsaid nothing of the sort in \u00a7 2107(c).  So Rule 4(a)(5) \nmotions do not necessarily result in an unbroken \nappeal period any more than Rule 4(a)(6) motions do. \nEven if Rule 4(a)(5) relief did retroactively create a \nsingle, continuous appeal period, the Fourth Circuit \nlacked any basis for concluding that Rule 4(a)(6) relief \ndoes not operate in the same way.  Both Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) refer to reopening \u201cthe time \nfor appeal\u201d or \u201cthe time to file an appeal.\u201d  Insomuch \nas extensions result in a continuous appeal period, \nthat language suggests a continuous appeal period \nunder the reopening mechanism, too. \n\n33 \n \nb. The second faulty premise is that a notice of \nappeal can ripen only when it is retroactively deemed \nto have been filed during a continuous, unbroken \nappeal period.  The Fourth Circuit created that \ncontinuity requirement from whole cloth, with no \nbasis in text.  And that novel requirement contradicts \nthis Court\u2019s functional approach to notices of appeal. \nThe function of a notice of appeal\u2014as its name \nsuggests\u2014is to put courts and other parties on notice \nthat a litigant is pursuing an appeal.  See Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767; FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  A premature \nnotice plainly serves that function regardless of \nwhether the appeal period is later deemed to have \nbeen continuous all along.  After all, retroactively \ndeeming an extended appeal period to have been \ncontinuous \u201ccannot change the fact that, absent time \ntravel, a lapse or interruption has occurred.\u201d  \nHollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 392. \nMoreover, imposing a continuity requirement for \nripening would upset the longstanding consensus \namong Courts of Appeals that a notice of appeal filed \nbefore Rule 54(b) certification ripens once certification \nis obtained.  See supra, at 29\u201330.  And to the extent \nthis continuity requirement is jurisdictional, it \nthreatens the viability of Rule 4(a)(2) and Rule \n4(a)(4)(B)(i) as well.  In all of these contexts, the initial \nnotice is not filed within a continuous appeal period\u2014\nor, indeed, within any appeal period at all. \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s passing suggestion \nthat a single filing cannot serve as both a notice of \nappeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) motion is meritless.  See \nPet.App.3a\u20134a.  Indeed, this Court has already \nreversed the Fourth Circuit for making the same \n\n34 \n \nfundamental mistake in another case.  In Smith, this \nCourt held that even though the \u201cFederal Rules do \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings,\u201d the Rules \u201cdo not \npreclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  502 U.S. at 249.  \nA notice of appeal, in other words, need not be filed on \na separate piece of paper that serves no other purpose.  \nSee id.  That logic compels the conclusion that a notice \nof appeal can also serve as a motion to reopen.  See, \ne.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 669\u201370 (Winters\u2019s filing \u201cmay \nserve more than one function\u201d); Withers, 638 F.3d at \n1062 (\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 387 (rejecting the argument \nthat a Rule 4(a)(6) \u201cmotion . . . cannot be construed as \na notice of appeal\u201d). \nIV. THE CASE IS AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE. \nFinally, this case is an ideal vehicle for answering \nthe Question Presented.  The question whether a \nprematurely filed notice of appeal can ripen upon Rule \n4(a)(6) reopening was fully briefed and definitively \nanswered below.  And it was the sole ground for the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s ruling.  See Pet.App.2a (\u201cBecause \nDonte Parrish did not file a timely notice of appeal \nfrom the judgment in this civil action, we dismiss his \nappeal for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).   \nTo the extent the Government again sides with \nParrish on the merits, see Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, \nthat is no basis for declining review.  This Court \nregularly grants certiorari and appoints an amicus \ncuriae to defend a Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling where there \n\n35 \n \nis no dispute between the parties on the Question \nPresented.  See, e.g., Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, \n336 (2022); Lange v. California, 594 U.S. 295, 301 \n(2021); McLane Co. v. E.E.O.C., 581 U.S. 72, 79 (2017).  \nIt should take the same tack here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nSeptember 9, 2024 \n \nAmanda R.

This action will provide the government's counter-arguments, its interpretation of the relevant rules (FRAP 4(a)), and its response to the petitioner's claims. This information is fundamental to understanding the legal landscape the Court will navigate. The potential for the government to 'confess error' (agree with the petitioner) is a low-probability but extremely high-impact piece of information that would almost certainly determine the outcome. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. The Design EIG is moderate; while retrieving the respondent's brief is a standard and crucial part of any SCOTUS case prediction strategy, executing this action reinforces the importance of this fundamental step and its place in a robust workflow. It's a validation of a core, necessary procedure rather than an exploration of a novel strategy.",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of appeal is best viewed as \n\u201cpremature\u201d to the reopened period, and \u201cthe technical \n\n12 \n \ndefect of prematurity  * * *  should not be allowed to \nextinguish an otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier \nMortg., 498 U.S. at 273; cf. Pet. App. 16a-18a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting) (drawing additional support from cir-\ncuit precedent giving effect to untimely notices of ap-\npeal filed before the time for appeal is extended under \nRule 4(a)(5)). \n2. Although the decision below is incorrect, peti-\ntioner fails to identify any compelling basis for further \nreview, particularly while the Advisory Committee is \nstudying the issue and has the authority to amend the \nrules in a manner that could obviate any need for addi-\ntional guidance from this Court.  See pp. 16-17, infra. \nPetitioner principally contends (Pet. 15-22) that the \ndecision below implicates a division of authority within \nthe courts of appeals, but petitioner overstates the de-\ngree of any such conflict.  District courts have had the \nauthority to reopen the time for appeal under Section \n2107(c) since 1991.  See Pub. L. No. 102-198, \u00a7 12, 105 \nStat. 1627; see also Fed. R. App. 4 advisory committee\u2019s \nnote (1991 Amendment).  But petitioner identifies (Pet. \n17-18) only one other published decision in which a court \nof appeals squarely addressed the jurisdictional ques-\ntion that petitioner seeks to present here.  See Winters \nv. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.) (concluding that a litigant who filed an untimely \nnotice of appeal and then successfully moved for reo-\npening of the appeal period \u201cdid not need to file a new \nnotice of appeal after the district court granted [his] \nmotion to reopen,\u201d under the principle that \u201c[a] notice \nof appeal filed too early, generally speaking, ripens \nwhen the window to appeal begins\u201d) (citing, inter alia, \nFirsTier Mortg., 498 U.S. at 273). \n\n13 \n \nPetitioner also relies (Pet. 18) on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in United States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055 \n(2011), but that case did not expressly resolve the same \njurisdictional issue.  The Ninth Circuit instead per-\nceived the key jurisdictional issue to be whether a pro \nse litigant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal should have been \n\u201cconstrued  * * *  as a motion to reopen\u201d the appeal pe-\nriod.  Id. at 1061.  After concluding that the district \ncourt should have construed the untimely notice as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted the motion, \nthe court of appeals did not then proceed to address \nwhether the pro se litigant needed to file any further \nnotice of appeal during the reopened period.  Id. at \n1061-1062.  The Ninth Circuit instead appears to have \nassumed that its jurisdiction was proper under those \ncircumstances.  See id. at 1062.  While that result is in-\nconsistent with the result reached by the Fourth Circuit \nhere, the precedential force of Withers remains unclear.  \nThis Court does not afford precedential effect to analo-\ngous \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings.\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citi-\nzens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998).   \nAs petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 19-21), the other \ncircuits to have addressed the same jurisdictional ques-\ntion have done so only in unpublished decisions.  See \nHammer v. Bortz, No. 23-1842, 2024 WL 2559204, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 24, 2024); Holden v. Attorney General of \nN.J., No. 21-1862, 2023 WL 8798084, at *1 n.4 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, No. 21-1027, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1. (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022), cert.  \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 454 (2022); Norwood v. East Allen \nCmty. Schs., 825 Fed. Appx. 383, 386-387 (7th Cir. \n2020); United States v. Marshall, 166 F.3d 349, 1998 \nWL 864012, at *2 (10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998) (Tbl.), cert. \n\n14 \n \ndenied, 528 U.S. 861 (1999).2  Those nonprecedential  \ndecisions would not preclude a future panel from reach-\ning a different conclusion and thus do not necessarily \nshow that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent had it arisen in one of those circuits.  And even \ncounting generously, petitioner has identified fewer \nthan ten opinions on point since reopening motions be-\ncame available in 1991.  The paucity of such decisions \nunderscores that the jurisdictional question does not \narise frequently\u2014and when it does, the courts of ap-\npeals have rarely considered it sufficiently important to \nwarrant a published opinion. \n3. In addition to the absence of any substantial con-\nflict, further review is unwarranted because the ques-\ntion presented lacks practical significance.  The ques-\ntion can arise only through an unlikely combination of \nprocedural missteps.  The district court may reopen the \ntime for appeal only if it first finds that a party entitled \nto receive notice of the entry of a judgment or order \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of the entry \nof the judgment or order.  28 U.S.C 2107(c)(1).  But in \nthe era of electronic filing, most litigants now receive \nimmediate notice of orders and judgments.  Petitioner \nemphasizes (Pet. 23) the possibility that pro se litigants \nmay need to rely on notice via the mail, but \u201c[m]any \ncourts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with \nthe court\u2019s permission,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 5 advisory com-\nmittee\u2019s note (2018 Amendment). \n \n2 Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 21) on Farrow is misplaced for the ad-\nditional reason that the litigant in that case simultaneously filed \nboth a motion to reopen the appeal period and a notice of appeal, \nwhile asking the district court to defer entering the notice until after \ngranting reopening.  See 2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1. \n\n15 \n \nMoreover, even with respect to the presumably small \nnumber of litigants who fail to receive the requisite no-\ntice, the question presented only arises if one of those \nlitigants wishes to appeal, the litigant cannot rely on the \ndistrict court\u2019s separate authority to extend the time for \nappeal, and the litigant makes a timely request that the \nappeal period be reopened\u2014but files a notice of appeal \nonly before the reopening, not after.  Notably, Section \n2107(c) imposes an outer limit of 180 days to request re-\nopening.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (court may act upon a \nmotion filed by the \u201cearlier\u201d of the expiration of 180 \ndays from the entry of the judgment or order at issue \nor 14 days after the moving party receives notice).  If \nthat 180-day period expires before the litigant requests \nreopening, the question presented makes no difference \nbecause the district court lacks authority to reopen the \nappeal period in any event.  And even for a timely re-\nquest, the district court cannot reopen the appeal period \nunless it first finds that \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  \n28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(2).  Petitioner does not demonstrate \nthat such a combination of circumstances is likely to oc-\ncur frequently, and the limited number of appellate deci-\nsions addressing the question presented suggests it does \nnot.  Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own prior court-appointed \ncounsel cited the \u201cthe relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to\u201d as one \nreason for declining to file a petition for rehearing en \nbanc on petitioner\u2019s behalf.  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2. \nPetitioner also overstates (Pet. 22) the practical sig-\nnificance of the decision below within the Fourth Circuit \nitself.  Although the decision below is incorrect, it estab-\nlishes a clear and easily applied jurisdictional rule going \nforward.  District courts in the Fourth Circuit may now \nadvise pro se litigants of the need to file a new notice of \n\n16 \n \nappeal in cases in which a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod is granted.  And although petitioner derides the \nfiling of a second notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod of appeal as a \u201chollow ritual,\u201d Pet. 30 (citation \nomitted), he does not show that filing a second notice \nwill be particularly difficult for most or indeed any liti-\ngants affected by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. \n4. This Court\u2019s review is also unwarranted at the \npresent time because the Advisory Committee has al-\nready taken steps to study whether changes to Rule 4(a) \nmay be warranted.  In Winters, the Sixth Circuit ob-\nserved that the Advisory Committee is \u201ccharge[d]  * * *  \nto review issues of precisely this sort\u201d and has the au-\nthority to \u201cimprov[e] the rules where needed.\u201d  88 F.4th \nat 672.  The Sixth Circuit further observed that the Ad-\nvisory Committee \u201cmay be a profitable next stage for \nthis debate,\u201d ibid.\u2014a sentiment endorsed by the dis-\nsenting judges in this case, see Pet. App. 68a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). \nOn October 9, 2024, after the filing of the petition for \na writ of certiorari in this case, the Advisory Committee \nvoted to form a subcommittee to address the issues \nraised by the Sixth Circuit in Winters and the Fourth \nCircuit in the decision below.  See Memorandum from \nEdward Hartnett to the Advisory Committee on the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, New Suggestion \nfrom Judge Sutton 1-3 (Sept. 5, 2024), reprinted in Ad-\nvisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Tab 7A, at 292-\n295 (Oct. 9, 2024) (reporter\u2019s memorandum describing \nWinters and this case and proposing a subcommittee); \nsee also Jacqueline Thomsen, Administrative Stays \nChanges Weighed After Justices\u2019 Criticism, Bloomberg \nLaw News (Oct. 10, 2024) (noting that the Advisory \nCommittee agreed to \u201clook into the rule on reopening \n\n17 \n \nthe time to file an appeal\u201d in light of Chief Judge Sut-\nton\u2019s suggestion). \nBecause the relevant provisions in Rule 4(a)(6) may \nwell change as a result of the rulemaking process, the \nquestion whether the current language of the rule sup-\nports petitioner may be of limited prospective im-\nportance.  And the Advisory Committee is fully capable \nof addressing the policy concerns that petitioner raises \nhere.  See Pet. 22-27. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \nBRIAN M.
