    "resolution_date": "Jun 05 2025",
    "legal_questions": [
      "Does a state violate the First Amendment\u2019s religion clauses by denying a religious organization an otherwise-available tax exemption because the organization does not meet the state\u2019s criteria for religious behavior?"
    ],

      "Yes"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) is the social ministry arm of the Diocese of Superior in Wisconsin, operating since 1917 to provide services to the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the Catholic Church's social ministry. The organization is controlled by the bishop of the Diocese, who serves as CCB\u2019s president and appoints its membership. CCB\u2019s mission is to provide service to people in need and advocate for justice, with a philosophy rooted in being \u201can effective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d The organization makes no distinctions based on race, sex, or religion in its services, employment, or board appointments.\n\nUnder CCB\u2019s umbrella are four sub-entities involved in this case: Barron County Developmental Services, Black River Industries, Diversified Services, and Headwaters. These entities provide various social services, including job placement and coaching for people with disabilities, community-based training, daily living services, and support programs. While CCB oversees these sub-entities and provides management services, the sub-entities themselves are primarily funded through government contracts and do not receive direct funding from the Diocese. Neither employees nor service recipients are required to be of any particular religious faith, and the programs do not provide religious training or attempt to promote the Catholic faith.\n\nCCB and its sub-entities sought an exemption from state unemployment insurance contributions in 2016, but the Department of Workforce Development denied the exemption. An administrative law judge reversed that decision, but then the Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) reversed again, finding the organizations were not operated primarily for religious purposes. Then, the circuit court sided with CCB, and then the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated LIRC\u2019s decision. Ultimately, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the organizations did not qualify for the religious purposes exemption under state law.",

While I have a summary of the case, reading the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is essential for understanding the specific legal arguments, the precedents cited, and the precise framing of the question presented by the petitioners. This level of detail is critical for predicting how the current Court, with its specific jurisprudence on religious liberty, will analyze the case. It moves the analysis from a general overview to the actual legal substance the Justices will confront. For design, this action reinforces a core principle of legal prediction: prioritizing primary source documents. Analyzing how petitioners frame their arguments to attract the Court's attention provides valuable data for building a more effective general prediction strategy. It helps refine the process of identifying the key legal hooks in any given case. The action is fundamental and provides a massive gain in task-specific knowledge.",

Although all agree \nCatholic Charities is controlled by a church\u2014the Dio-\ncese of Superior\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme Court held \nthat Catholic Charities is not \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes\u201d and thus does not qualify for the \ntax exemption. Specifically, the court held that Catho-\nlic Charities\u2019 activities are not \u201ctypical\u201d religious activ-\nities because Catholic Charities serves and employs \nnon-Catholics, Catholic Charities does not \u201cattempt to \nimbue program participants with the Catholic faith,\u201d \nand its services to the poor and needy could also be \nprovided by secular organizations.  \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Does a state violate the First Amendment\u2019s Re-\nligion Clauses by denying a religious organiza-\ntion an otherwise-available tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not meet the state\u2019s \ncriteria for religious behavior? \n2. In addressing federal constitutional challenges, \nmay state courts require proof of unconstitu-\ntionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d \n \n \n\nii \n \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nCatholic Charities Bureau, Inc. does not have a \nparent corporation and does not issue stock.  \nCatholic Charities Bureau, Inc. is the parent corpo-\nration of Barron County Developmental Services, Inc.; \nDiversified Services, Inc.; Black River Industries, Inc.; \nand Headwaters, Inc.

See St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772 (1981); California v. Grace Brethren \nChurch, 457 U.S. 393 (1982). Lower courts had divided \nover whether church schools were church-controlled \norganizations \u201coperated primarily for religious pur-\nposes,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B), and thus exempt from \nunemployment tax, and\u2014if not exempt\u2014over whether \nFUTA and its cognate state statutes violated the First \nAmendment. \nBut neither case resolved the constitutional ques-\ntions presented. In St. Martin, the Court unanimously \nheld that church schools that were not separately in-\ncorporated counted as \u201cchurches\u201d and were thus pro-\ntected under the independent exemption for churches \nin 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). And in Grace Brethren, the \nCourt held that the federal district court from which \nappeal had been taken lacked jurisdiction under the \nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. 1341, so the case had to \nbe dismissed. In both cases, the Court expressly de-\nclined to reach the First Amendment questions on \nwhich review had been granted. Congress later added \na specific exemption that covered religious schools, but \nthe status of other church-controlled but separately in-\ncorporated entities remains unaddressed to this day.  \nThe split is thus unfinished business. And as the \ndecision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in this case \nshows, it is a split that is growing. The Wisconsin Su-\n\n2 \n \npreme Court recognized the split and weighed in, con-\ncluding that Catholic Charities, the separately incor-\nporated charitable arm of the Roman Catholic Diocese \nof Superior, was not \u201coperated primarily for religious \npurposes.\u201d Acknowledging that Catholic Charities un-\ndertakes its charitable activities because of its sin-\ncerely held religious beliefs and to carry out the reli-\ngious mission the bishop has given it, the court never-\ntheless held that Catholic Charities\u2019 activities have no \nreligious purpose because those activities are not, in \nthat court\u2019s view, \u201ctypical\u201d for a religious organization. \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court thought it atypical of \nreligion that Catholic Charities does not \u201cattempt to \nimbue\u201d those it helps with the Catholic faith, and that \nit hires employees \u201cregardless of religion.\u201d And the \ncourt h\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Although all agree \nCatholic Charities is controlled by a church\u2014the Dio-\ncese of Superior\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme Court held \nthat Catholic Charities is not \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes\u201d and thus does not qualify for the \ntax exemption. Specifically, the court held that Catho-\nlic Charities\u2019 activities are not \u201ctypical\u201d religious activ-\nities because Catholic Charities serves and employs \nnon-Catholics, Catholic Charities does not \u201cattempt to \nimbue program participants with the Catholic faith,\u201d \nand its services to the poor and needy could also be \nprovided by secular organizations.  \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Does a state violate the First Amendment\u2019s Re-\nligion Clauses by denying a religious organiza-\ntion an otherwise-available tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not meet the state\u2019s \ncriteria for religious behavior? \n2. In addressing federal constitutional challenges, \nmay state courts require proof of unconstitu-\ntionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d \n \n \n\nii \n \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nCatholic Charities Bureau, Inc. does not have a \nparent corporation and does not issue stock.  \nCatholic Charities Bureau, Inc. is the parent corpo-\nration of Barron County Developmental Services, Inc.; \nDiversified Services, Inc.; Black River Industries, Inc.; \nand Headwaters, Inc.

See St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772 (1981); California v. Grace Brethren \nChurch, 457 U.S. 393 (1982). Lower courts had divided \nover whether church schools were church-controlled \norganizations \u201coperated primarily for religious pur-\nposes,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B), and thus exempt from \nunemployment tax, and\u2014if not exempt\u2014over whether \nFUTA and its cognate state statutes violated the First \nAmendment. \nBut neither case resolved the constitutional ques-\ntions presented. In St. Martin, the Court unanimously \nheld that church schools that were not separately in-\ncorporated counted as \u201cchurches\u201d and were thus pro-\ntected under the independent exemption for churches \nin 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). And in Grace Brethren, the \nCourt held that the federal district court from which \nappeal had been taken lacked jurisdiction under the \nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. 1341, so the case had to \nbe dismissed. In both cases, the Court expressly de-\nclined to reach the First Amendment questions on \nwhich review had been granted. Congress later added \na specific exemption that covered religious schools, but \nthe status of other church-controlled but separately in-\ncorporated entities remains unaddressed to this day.  \nThe split is thus unfinished business. And as the \ndecision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in this case \nshows, it is a split that is growing. The Wisconsin Su-\n\n2 \n \npreme Court recognized the split and weighed in, con-\ncluding that Catholic Charities, the separately incor-\nporated charitable arm of the Roman Catholic Diocese \nof Superior, was not \u201coperated primarily for religious \npurposes.\u201d Acknowledging that Catholic Charities un-\ndertakes its charitable activities because of its sin-\ncerely held religious beliefs and to carry out the reli-\ngious mission the bishop has given it, the court never-\ntheless held that Catholic Charities\u2019 activities have no \nreligious purpose because those activities are not, in \nthat court\u2019s view, \u201ctypical\u201d for a religious organization. \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court thought it atypical of \nreligion that Catholic Charities does not \u201cattempt to \nimbue\u201d those it helps with the Catholic faith, and that \nit hires employees \u201cregardless of religion.\u201d And the \ncourt held that because Catholic Charities provides \nservices that \u201ccan be provided by organizations of ei-\nther religious or secular motivations,\u201d those services \ndo not have a religious purpose. Put another way, it \ndoesn\u2019t matter if Catholic Charities gives a cup of wa-\nter in Jesus\u2019 name, because non-religious charities of-\nfer cups of water too. \nThat absurd result deepens a split between state \ncourts that require religious entities to conform to ste-\nreotypes to qualify for the \u201creligious purposes\u201d exemp-\ntion and those that do not. Four states look to the sin-\ncerity of the entity\u2019s religious beliefs to decide whether \nit qualifies for the religious purposes exemption, thus \navoiding constitutional questions. Four other states, \nnow including Wisconsin, instead determine \u201creligious \npurpose\u201d based on an assessment of whether a reli-\ngious organization\u2019s charitable activities are \u201ctypical\u201d \nof religion or \u201cobjective[ly]\u201d religious. And that thrusts \nstate governments into a thicket of First Amendment \n\n3 \n \nquestions under the Free Exercise Clause, the Estab-\nlishment Clause, and the church autonomy doctrine, \nnot least because it forces agencies and courts to sec-\nond-guess the religious decisions of religious bodies. \nAnd that split matters. Religious bodies like Peti-\ntioners are deeply affected, having to pay unemploy-\nment taxes that otherwise could be helping the needy. \nMoreover, because Petitioners are forced to pay into \nthe state unemployment compensation program, they \ncannot participate in their church\u2019s own unemploy-\nment compensation system along with Wisconsin dio-\nceses, including the Diocese of Superior itself. And be-\ncause the Tax Injunction Act prevents lower federal \ncourts from addressing the matter, only this Court can \nresolve the split and the underlying constitutional is-\nsues in any comprehensive way. \nFinally, the decision below deepened a different ex-\nisting split over the proper burden of proof applicable \nto federal constitutional claims. According to the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court, its state laws are presump-\ntively constitutional unless a plaintiff can prove un-\nconstitutionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This \nheightened standard conflicts with the practices of all \nfederal courts and most state courts\u2014which analyze \nfederal constitutional claims without such a burden\u2014\nand is fundamentally at odds with this Court\u2019s consti-\ntutional jurisprudence. And because only a few state \ncourts still adhere to this heightened standard for ad-\njudicating federal constitutional claims, it too gener-\nally avoids federal review. \nThe Court should not allow these longstanding \nsplits to fester any longer. It should grant review on \nboth questions presented. \n\n4 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(App.1a-124a) is reported at 3 N.W.3d 666.The deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin (App.125a-\n168a) is reported at 987 N.W.2d 778. The decision of \nthe Court of Appeals of Wisconsin certifying this ap-\npeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin (App.169a-\n188a) is not reported. The decision of the Douglas \nCounty Circuit Court (App.189a-211a) is not reported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its opinion \non March 14, 2024. App.1a. On May 30, 2024, Justice \nBarrett extended the time to file a petition for certio-\nrari until August 11, 2024. This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1257(a). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe free exercise thereof  * * *  .\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. I. \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act states in rele-\nvant part that \u201c[t]his section shall not apply to service \nperformed (1) in the employ of (A) a church or conven-\ntion or association of churches, (B) an organization \nwhich is operated primarily for religious purposes and \nwhich is operated, supervised, controlled, or princi-\npally supported by a church or convention or associa-\ntion of churches, or (C) an elementary or secondary \nschool which is operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes, which is described in section 501(c)(3), and \n\n5 \n \nwhich is exempt from tax under section 501(a).\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 3309(b)(1). \nWisconsin\u2019s Unemployment Insurance and Re-\nserves laws state in relevant part that \u201c\u2019Employ-\nment\u2019  * * *  does not include service:  * * *  In the em-\nploy of an organization operated primarily for reli-\ngious purposes and operated, supervised, controlled, \nor principally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act and the \nreligious purposes exemption \nIn 1935, Congress enacted the Federal Unemploy-\nment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. 3301-3311, which \n\u201ccalled for a cooperative federal-state program of ben-\nefits to unemployed workers.\u201d St. Martin Evangelical \nLutheran Church v. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 775 \n(1981). As part of this cooperative system, employers \npay the federal government a percentage of their em-\nployees\u2019 annual wages to fund job service programs, to \nsupport state unemployment agencies (in times of high \nunemployment), and to support a federally adminis-\ntered fund against which states may borrow to pay un-\nemployment benefits. But these employers can claim a \ncredit of up to 90% of this federal tax for \u201ccontribu-\ntions\u201d they have made to federally approved state un-\nemployment compensation programs (which provide \nbenefits directly to unemployed workers), thus reduc-\ning the amount of money they owe to the federal gov-\nernment and reducing their overall tax burden. Id. at \n775 n.3; 26 U.S.C. 3302(a)(1). \nAccordingly\u2014and to ensure their programs remain \nfederally approved\u2014all states (including Wisconsin) \n\n6 \n \nhave \u201ccomplementary\u201d statutes which impose, at a \nminimum, the coverage mandated by FUTA. See Wim-\nberly v. Labor & Indus. Rels. Comm\u2019n of Mo., 479 U.S. \n511, 514 (1987) (\u201cThe Act establishes certain mini-\nmum federal standards that a State must satisfy in or-\nder for a State to participate in the program.\u201d); Bleich \nv. Maimonides Sch., 849 N.E.2d 185, 188 (Mass. 2006) \n(similar). The Secretary of Labor reviews all state \nFUTA-implementation statutes, 26 U.S.C 3304(a), \nand certifies annually that state laws meet FUTA\u2019s re-\nquirements, 26 U.S.C. 3304(b). \nFUTA exempts church-controlled religious organi-\nzations \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nfrom payment of the unemployment tax. 26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(B). This exemption was enacted by Con-\ngress in 1970. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 776. Since then, \nforty-seven states have adopted language identical, or \nnearly identical, to FUTA\u2019s language.1 \n \n1  \nTwenty-three states and the District of Columbia use lan-\nguage identical to Section 3309(b)(1)(B). See Conn. Gen. Stat. \n\u00a7 31-222(a)(1)(E)(i)(II); Del. Code tit. 19, \u00a7 3302(10)(D)(i)(II); D.C. \nCode \u00a7 51-101(2)(A)(iv)(I)(b); Ga.

Va. \nCode \u00a7 21A-1A-17(9)(A).  \n \n\n7 \n \nTwice before, this Court considered constitutional \nclaims challenging the scope of the religious exemp-\ntion but resolved both cases on alternative grounds. In \nSt. Martin, this Court held that the religious school \nplaintiffs were exempt from South Dakota\u2019s unemploy-\nment tax under a different FUTA provision (Section \n3309(b)(1)(A)), making it \u201cunnecessary  * * *  to con-\nsider the First Amendment issues raised by petition-\ners.\u201d St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 788. And in California v. \nGrace Brethren Church, this Court resolved the case \n \n \nSixteen states use identical language, including \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes,\u201d but make small grammatical \nchanges to other parts of the subsection. See Ala. Code \u00a7 25-4-\n10(b)(21)(a)(2); Alaska Stat. \u00a7 23.20.526(d)(9)(B); Ark. Code \u00a7 11-\n10-210(a)(4)(A)(ii); Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code \u00a7 634.5(a)(2); Fla.

Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2). \n \nSeven states have made minor substantive changes to \nFUTA\u2019s language, for example to specify that schools are in-\ncluded, or that entities must be nonprofit. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \n\u00a7 23-615(B)(1) (schools); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 8-70-140(1)(a) \n(schools); 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 405/211.3(A)(2) (schools); Minn. \nStat. \u00a7 268.035 subd. 20(5) (nonprofit status); N.H. Rev. Stat. \n\u00a7 282-A:9, IV(p)(1) (schools); N.J. Stat. \u00a7 43:21-19(i)(1)(D)(i)(II) \n(schools); Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 27-3-105(b)(ii) (deleting second use of \u201cop-\nerated\u201d). \n \nOf the remaining four states, one utilized identical language, \nbut has since repealed it. 2005 Or. Laws c. 218, \u00a7 1 (amending Or. \nRev. Stat. \u00a7 657.072(1)(a)(B)). Three states employ religious ex-\nemptions that turn on ministerial status or function. Haw. Rev. \nStat. \u00a7 383-7(a)(9)(A); Mont. Code \u00a7 39-51-204(2)(a); N.Y. Lab. \nLaw \u00a7 563(2)(a)-(c). \n\n8 \n \non jurisdictional grounds, holding that the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act prohibited the federal district court from en-\njoining the collection of state taxes. 457 U.S. 393, 417 \n(1982). \nAfter this Court\u2019s decisions in St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren, Congress again amended FUTA to make \nclear that religious schools are exempt so long as they \nare \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d\u2014even \nif not \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or association of \nchurches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(C) (enacted 1997).  \nWisconsin law generally requires nonprofits with \nfour or more employees (and which meet other mini-\nmum qualifications) to pay into its state unemploy-\nment program. Wis. Stat. 108.02(13)(b). Through its \n(h)(2) exemption, the State provides a religious exemp-\ntion identical to FUTA\u2019s Section 3309(b)(1)(B) save for \nthe omission of two instances of \u201cwhich is.\u201d Compare \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2) \nwith \n26 \nU.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(B). \nB.  Catholic Charities and its religious mission \nPetitioner Catholic Charities Bureau is a Wiscon-\nsin nonprofit corporation and the social ministry arm \nof the Diocese of Superior, a diocese of the Roman \nCatholic Church. App.371a. Its mission is \u201c[t]o carry \non the redeeming work of our Lord by reflecting gospel \nvalues and the moral teaching of the church.\u201d \nApp.382a, 428a. Catholic Charities carries out this \nmission by \u201cproviding services to the poor and disad-\nvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of the \nCatholic Church.\u201d App.383a, 431a. Its purpose is \u201cto be \nan effective sign of the charity of Christ\u201d by providing \nservices without making distinctions \u201cby race, sex, or \n\n9 \n \nreligion in reference to clients served, staff employed \nand board members appointed.\u201d App.383a, 431a. This \nis a mandate of Catholic social teaching, and a primary \ntenet of the faith. App.373a-379a. Catholic Charities \npledges that it \u201cwill in its activities and actions reflect \ngospel values and will be consistent with its mission \nand the mission of the Diocese of Superior.\u201d App.384a, \n429a. Catholic Charities operates dozens of programs \nin service to the elderly, the disabled, the poor, and \nthose in need of disaster relief. App.373a. In accord-\nance with the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity, \nCatholic Charities is separately incorporated from the \nDiocese of Superior and, like the Diocese, has 501(c)(3) \nstatus under the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s group tax \nexemption. App.386a-402a. \nPetitioners Headwaters, Barron County Develop-\nmental Services, Diversified Services, and Black River \nIndustries are Catholic Charities\u2019 sub-entities that \nprovide services primarily to developmentally disabled \nindividuals. App.128a-130a. They are each separately \nincorporated as Wisconsin nonprofit corporations, and \neach also enjoys 501(c)(3) status as part of the Roman \nCatholic Church. App.386a-402a. \nThe bishop of the Diocese of Superior has plenary \ncontrol over Catholic Charities and its sub-entities: he \n\u201coversees CCB in its entirety, including its sub-enti-\nties.\u201d App.130a; App.7a-8a. He serves as president of \nCatholic Charities and \u201cappoints its membership,\u201d \nwhich consists of leading diocesan clergy and the exec-\nutive director. App.7a, 415a-417a. The bishop also ap-\npoints the boards of directors of Catholic Charities and \nits sub-entities. App.419a, 422a. \n\n10 \n \nCatholic Charities\u2019 membership oversees the min-\nistry and its sub-entities to ensure fulfillment of Cath-\nolic Charities\u2019 mission in compliance with Catholic so-\ncial teaching. App.28a-29a, 416a-417a. Each sub-en-\ntity signs Catholic Charities\u2019 Guiding Principles of \nCorporate Affiliation, which gives Catholic Charities \nresponsibility over many of the sub-entity\u2019s major op-\nerating decisions. App.422a-425a. Catholic Charities \nand its sub-entities are directed to comply fully with \nCatholic social teaching in providing services. App.8a, \n425a. And all new key staff and director-level positions \nreceive a manual entitled The Social Ministry of Cath-\nolic Charities Bureau in the Diocese of Superior, which \nthey must review during orientation. App.371a-385a. \nIn addition, every new employee receives a welcome \nletter with the Catholic Charities\u2019 mission statement, \ncode of ethics, and statement of the ministry\u2019s philos-\nophy toward service. App.131a; App207a; App.380a-\n383a, 469a-475a. All employees are instructed to abide \nby these documents. App.130a-131a; 207a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 ministry is also guided by the \nprinciples of its Catholic faith. Specifically, Catholic \nteaching \u201c\u2018demand[s] that Catholics respond in charity \nto those in need.\u201d App.128a, 58a; see also Pope Bene-\ndict XVI, Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 32 (2005) (\u201c[Charity] has \nbeen an essential part of [the Church\u2019s] mission from \nthe very beginning.\u201d). Indeed, the Catholic Church \n\u201cclaims works of charity as its own inalienable duty \nand right.\u201d Pope Paul VI, Apostolicam Actuositatem \n\u00b6 8 (1965). \nCatholic teaching also confirms that the Church\u2019s \ncharitable ministry \u201cmust embrace the entire human \nrace.\u201d Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, Com-\npendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \u00b6 581 \n\n11 \n \n(2004). The Church therefore instructs that charity \nshould be exercised \u201cin an impartial manner towards\u201d \n\u201cmembers of other religions.\u201d Congregation for Bish-\nops, Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops \n\u201cApostolorum Successores\u201d \u00b6 208 (2004); Apostolicam \nActuositatem \u00b6 8 (\u201c[C]haritable enterprises can and \nshould reach out to all persons and all needs.\u201d). Char-\nity, moreover, \u201ccannot be used as a means of engaging \nin * * * proselytism.\u201d Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 31; see also \nApostolorum Successores \u00b6 196 (instructing not to \n\u201cmisus[e] works of charity for purposes of proselyt-\nism\u201d). As Pope Benedict XVI explained, \u201cThose who \npractise charity in the Church\u2019s name will never seek \nto impose the Church\u2019s faith upon others.\u201d Deus Cari-\ntas Est \u00b6 31. \nC. Catholic Charities seeks to participate in the \nWisconsin bishops\u2019 unemployment assistance \nprogram \nFor the Catholic Church, \u201c[t]he obligation to pro-\nvide unemployment benefits  * * *  spring[s] from the \nfundamental principle of the moral order in this \nsphere.\u201d App.433a (quoting St. Pope John Paul II, La-\nborem Exercens (1981)). Accordingly, in 1986, the Wis-\nconsin bishops created the Church Unemployment \nPay Program (CUPP) \u201cto assist parishes, schools and \nother church employers in meeting their social justice \nresponsibilities by providing church funded unemploy-\nment coverage\u201d in accordance with Catholic teaching. \nApp.433a. This program provides the same level of \nbenefits to unemployed individuals as the State\u2019s sys-\ntem \u201cmore efficiently at lesser cost.\u201d App.149a, 448a, \n478a. Participating in the CUPP instead of the state\u2019s \nprogram would allow Catholic Charities to direct ad-\nditional resources towards helping the needy.  \n\n12 \n \nIn 2016\u2014after a different sub-entity of Catholic \nCharities (not a Petitioner here) was held to qualify for \nthe (h)(2) exemption, App.497a-504a\u2014Catholic Chari-\nties sought a similar determination from Respondent \nDepartment of Workforce Development (DWD). DWD, \nhowever, concluded that Catholic Charities and its \nsub-entities were not operated primarily for religious \npurposes. 2  App.351a-370a. Catholic Charities ap-\npealed. After a two-day hearing, the administrative \nlaw judge reversed. App.291a-350a. \nDWD then petitioned Respondent Labor and In-\ndustry Review Commission (LIRC) for review. LIRC \nreversed, holding that the (h)(2) exemption turns on \nan organization\u2019s \u201cactivities, not the religious motiva-\ntion behind them or the organization\u2019s founding prin-\nciples.\u201d App.227a, 242a, 258a, 273a, 290a. And be-\ncause Petitioners \u201cprovide[ ] essentially secular ser-\nvices and engage[ ] in activities that are not religious \nper se,\u201d LIRC concluded that they do not qualify. \nApp.226a, 241a, 257a, 272a, 289a. \nCatholic Charities sought review in Douglas \nCounty Circuit Court. The Circuit Court reversed \nLIRC\u2019s decision, holding that under the \u201cplain lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute, \u201cthe test is \nreally why the organizations are operating, not what \nthey are operating.\u201d App.209a-210a. And since Peti-\ntioners operate out \u201cof th[e] religious motive of the \nCatholic Church  * * *  of serving the underserved,\u201d \ntheir primary purposes are religious. App.209a. \n \n2  \nIt is undisputed that Petitioners are \u201coperated, supervised, \ncontrolled, or principally supported by a church.\u201d App.218a-219a, \n297a. Petitioners thus qualify for the (h)(2) exemption if they are \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d App.5a. \n\n13 \n \nDWD and LIRC appealed. The Court of Appeals in-\nitially certified the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, but that court refused the certification. \nApp.169a, 11a n.8. After the refusal, the Court of Ap-\npeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s order and reinstated \nLIRC\u2019s decision. App.127a. The Court of Appeals held \nthat \u201cunder a plain language reading of the statute,\u201d \nto qualify as operated primarily for religious purposes, \n\u201cthe organization must not only have a religious moti-\nvation, but the services provided\u2014its activities\u2014must \nalso be primarily religious in nature.\u201d App.146a. It \ntherefore concluded that although Catholic Charities \nand its sub-entities \u201chave a professed religious moti-\nvation  * * *  to fulfill the Catechism of the Catholic \nChurch,\u201d their \u201cactivities  * * *  are the provision of \ncharitable social services that are neither inherently \nor primarily religious activities.\u201d App.163a-165a. The \ncourt of appeals further held that \u201cthe First Amend-\nment is not implicated in this case,\u201d rejecting CCB\u2019s \nconstitutional arguments. App.127a, 157a-159a. Cath-\nolic Charities petitioned the Supreme Court of Wiscon-\nsin for review. \nOn March 14, 2024, the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nheld that whether an entity was \u201coperated primarily \nfor religious purposes\u201d required an \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d \ninto the entity\u2019s \u201cactivities\u201d to determine whether they \nwere \u201c\u2018primarily\u2019 religious in nature.\u201d App.27a, 29a. As \npart of this inquiry, the court determined that certain \n\u201ccriteria\u201d\u2014\u201c[a]lthough \nnot \nrequired\u201d\u2014would \nbe \n\u201cstrong indications that the activities are primarily re-\nligious in nature.\u201d App.29a. These \u201cobjective\u201d criteria \nfocused on \u201c[t]ypical\u201d forms of religious exercise: \nwhether the entity proselytized, whether it \u201cpartici-\npated in worship services, religious outreach, cere-\n\n14 \n \nmony, or religious education,\u201d and whether its employ-\nment and ministry are \u201copen to all participants re-\ngardless of religion.\u201d App.26a; App.29a-30a. \nApplying this test, the court found that Catholic \nCharities\u2019 \u201cactivities are primarily charitable and sec-\nular\u201d because the organization does not \u201cattempt to \nimbue program participants with the Catholic faith \nnor supply any religious materials to program partici-\npants or employees,\u201d and because its services \u201care \nopen to all participants regardless of religion.\u201d \nApp.29a-30a.  \nThe Court also rejected Catholic Charities\u2019 federal \nconstitutional arguments, repeating seven times that \nCatholic Charities had to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable \ndoubt\u201d that the Court\u2019s new interpretation of the (h)(2) \nexemption violated the federal constitution. App.7a, \n37a, 44a, 47a, 50a, 51a. First, the court held that its \ninterpretation did not entangle courts in religious \nquestions because \u201c[a] court need only determine what \nthe nature of the motivations and activities of the or-\nganizations are.\u201d App.40a. The court acknowledged \nthat its analysis \u201crequires \u2018some degree of involve-\nment\u2019 with religion,\u201d but concluded that this is \u201cinher-\nent\u201d in any statutory exemption scheme. Ibid. (citation \nomitted). \nWriting in dissent, Justice Rebecca Grassl Bradley \n(joined by Chief Justice Ziegler and in part by Justice \nHagedorn) highlighted numerous errors in the major-\nity\u2019s approach. App.51a-54a. The dissent pointed out \nthat the majority\u2019s test puts courts in the \u201cconstitu-\ntionally tenuous position of second-guessing the reli-\ngious significance and character of a nonprofit\u2019s ac-\ntions.\u201d App.116a. And it explained that the court\u2019s ap-\nproach \u201cbelittles Catholic Charities\u2019 faith\u2014and many \n\n15 \n \nother faith traditions\u2014by mischaracterizing their re-\nligiously motivated charitable activities as \u2018secular in \nnature\u2019\u2014that is, not really religious at all.\u201d App.83a \n(citation omitted). Whether an activity is \u201creligious in \nnature\u201d was an inherently entangling question: \u201cFor \nwhat constitutes an activity that is \u2018religious in nature\u2019 \nto change from religion to religion, the court must \nstudy the doctrines of the various faiths and decide for \nitself what religious practices are actually religious. \nThe Constitution bars civil courts from such intrusions \ninto spiritual affairs.\u201d App.117a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. The decision below deepens a 4-4 split over \nwhether states can, consonant with the First \nAmendment, deny church organizations a tax \nexemption because they do not engage in \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities.   \nThe split this Court granted certiorari to review in \nSt. Martins and Grace Brethren remains unresolved, \nand the decision below deepens the split. Four state \nsupreme courts deciding whether an unemployment \ntax exemption is available to a church-controlled reli-\ngious organization under FUTA have held that the \nchurch\u2019s sincere beliefs about whether its activities are \nundertaken to further its religious mission are dispos-\nitive. By contrast, four other state supreme courts\u2014\nincluding now the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\u2014have \n\n16 \n \nengaged in a \u201csearching case-by-case\u201d analysis of a re-\nligious entity\u2019s activities, rejecting or ignoring any \nFirst Amendment arguments to the contrary.3 \nA. Four \nstates, \nto \navoid \nconstitutional \ninfringement, \nfocus \non \nwhether \nan \norganization has sincere religious beliefs \nmotivating its activities. \nThe highest courts of four states focus on whether \nan organization has sincere religious beliefs indicating \nthat the purpose of its activities is rooted in religious \nmotivation.  \nIdaho. The Idaho Supreme Court held that a bak-\nery owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist \nChurch was operated primarily for religious purposes \ndespite its commercial and secular activities. In reach-\ning this conclusion, the Court reversed the state com-\nmission\u2019s finding that the \u201ccommercial and competi-\ntive nature of the production and marketing of the food \nproduct produced\u201d meant the bakery should \u201cnot [be] \nconsidered  * * *  a \u2018religious activity.\u2019\u201d Department of \nEmp. v. Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, \n1372 (Idaho 1979). Instead, the court recognized that \nthe reason the church operated the bakery was plainly \nreligious: \u201cThe tenets of the Seventh Day Adventists \nreligion stress the value of labor, and work experience \nis conceived to be an integral part of the students\u2019 re-\nligious training. Hence, as a part of their religious \ntraining, students at the academy are assigned to \nwork at a bakery, a laundry, a cafeteria, the school or \na farm.\u201d Id. at 1371. It was for this religious reason \n \n3  \nDue to the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. 1341, claims con-\ncerning these state tax exemptions are not heard in the lower fed-\neral courts. \n\n17 \n \nthat \u201cthe Seventh Day Adventists Corporation owns, \noperates and controls Champion Bake-N-Serve.\u201d Ibid. \nThe court rejected the idea that \u201ccommercial aspects \ncoexistent with the primary religious purpose\u201d under-\nmined those purposes. Id. at 1372. Relying on this \nstatutory interpretation, the Idaho court did not reach \nany constitutional questions. Id. at 1373. Cf. Nampa \nChristian Schs. Found., Inc. v. State of Idaho, 719 P.2d \n1178, 1180 (Idaho 1986) (concluding that religious \nschool was operated primarily for religious purposes \nand thus not \u201caddress[ing] the constitutional issues \nraised by both parties\u201d). \nIowa. The Iowa Supreme Court similarly inter-\npreted its identical religious exemption to \u201cavoid con-\nstitutional issues,\u201d holding that a separately incorpo-\nrated Lutheran secondary school was operated for pri-\nmarily religious purposes. Community Lutheran Sch. \nv. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 289-291 \n(Iowa 1982). Employing what it called \u201cunusual re-\nspect to decisions of the United States Supreme Court \ninterpreting identical language in federal statutes,\u201d \nthe court surveyed the caselaw, including St. Martin \nand Grace Brethren. Id. at 289. The court rejected the \nstate unemployment agency\u2019s assertion that the \u201cedu-\ncational function\u201d of the school was \u201cdominant,\u201d in-\nstead concluding that the evidence showed the \u201cpur-\npose for creating and operating the parochial schools \nis to rear children in the Christian faith \u2018in all their \nschooling[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 290-291. Because the court inter-\npreted the religious exemption to focus on the reason \nfor which the school operated, it did not need to reach \nthe school\u2019s claim that \u201crefusal to exempt them would \nconstitute an unconstitutional denial of religious free-\ndom under the first amendment to the United States \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 289.  \n\n18 \n \nMaine. In Schwartz v. Unemployment Insurance \nCommission, a religious ministry provided \u201creligious \nand secular services to the coastal communities\u201d of \nMaine. 895 A.2d 965, 968 (Me. 2006). This included \n\u201ctelemedicine,\u201d an \u201cafter-school program,\u201d and \u201ca used \nclothing shop and food pantry.\u201d Id. at 968-969. Inter-\npreting a religious exemption that was substantively \nidentical to FUTA and the Wisconsin statute, the court \nrejected the claim that these activities undermined the \nreligious purpose of the ministry: \u201cThe fact that the \nMission provides health care to islanders and an after-\nschool program for students does not diminish its con-\ntinuing religious purpose.\u201d Id. at 971. The court also \nexplained that charitable work and even a charitable \npurpose are not inconsistent with a primarily religious \npurpose: \u201cThe fact that an organization has a charita-\nble purpose and does charitable work does not require \nthe conclusion that its purposes are not primarily reli-\ngious.\u201d Id. at 970. Instead, based on \u201csubstantial evi-\ndence in the record,\u201d the court concluded that the mo-\ntivation and reason for the ministry\u2019s charitable activ-\nity was primarily religious. Ibid. The court did not dis-\nturb the lower court\u2019s \u201cexpansive\u201d reading of the ex-\nemption because the \u201cright to free exercise of religion\u201d \nwas at stake. See Schwartz v. Maine Unemployment \nIns. Comm\u2019n, No. AP-2003-028, at 8 (Me. Super. Ct. \nAug. 25, 2004) (quoting Kendall v. Director of Div. of \nEmp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985)). \nMassachusetts. In a case with facts closely resem-\nbling this one, the Supreme Judicial Court refused to \nparse the religious activities of a Catholic charity, con-\ncluding that courts must be \u201cquite cautious in attempt-\ning to define, for tax [and unemployment insurance] \npurposes, what is or is not a \u2018religious\u2019 activity  * * *  \n\n19 \n \nfor obvious policy and constitutional reasons.\u201d Ken-\ndall, 473 N.E.2d at 199 (alterations in original). As \nhere, the religious motivations of the charity were not \ndisputed; instead, \u201c[a]t oral argument the claimant  \n* * *  argued that this [religious] motivation is distinct \nfrom the Center\u2019s secular purpose, the education of the \nmentally retarded.\u201d Id. at 199. The court rejected this \nargument, \u201cdeclin[ing] to impose such rigid criteria in \ndefining religious pursuits.\u201d Ibid.4 \nOther courts. Numerous state intermediate ap-\npellate courts have also concluded that this religious \nexception focuses on sincerity of mission or motivation. \nFor example, in a case distinguished below, App.83a, \n143a-144a n.10, the Illinois Court of Appeals rejected \nthe state\u2019s attempts to recharacterize and second-\nguess the nature of a religious charity\u2019s activities. See \nBy The Hand Club for Kids, NFP, Inc. v. Department \nof Emp. Sec., 188 N.E.3d 1196, 1198 (Ill. Ct. App. \n2020). The court relied on the church-supervised after-\nschool program\u2019s sincere assertion that its activities \n \n4  \nIn Grace Lutheran Church v. North Dakota Employment Se-\ncurity Bureau, the North Dakota Supreme Court relied on this \nCourt\u2019s precedents to determine that \u201cchurch schools\u201d were cate-\ngorically \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d 294 N.W.2d \n767, 771 n.11 (N.D. 1980) (citing NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 \nU.S. 490 (1979); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975); Lemon v. \nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971)). Accordingly, the court did not \nseparately analyze the church organization\u2019s activities.  \n \nSimilarly, the Vermont Supreme Court, without taking a \nside, recognized the existence of the split and explained that \nthese \u201cissues have been litigated extensively in other jurisdic-\ntions with mixed results, especially with respect to whether sim-\nilar organizations are operated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d \nMid Vt. Christian Sch. v. Department of Emp. & Training, 885 \nA.2d 1210, 1213. (Vt. 2005). \n\n20 \n \nwere religious: \u201cAccording to By The Hand, the activi-\nties of feeding hungry children, helping struggling \nreaders, and occasionally caring for children\u2019s medical \nneeds are no less religious activities than leading Bible \nstudies, chapel services, scripture memorization, and \nprayers.\u201d Id. at 1214. The government therefore \u201cerred \nby recharacterizing them as secular activities for pur-\nposes of the exemption from the unemployment com-\npensation system.\u201d Ibid. This meant the court did not \nneed to \u201creach the parties\u2019 constitutional arguments.\u201d \nIbid.  \nSimilarly, the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2014interpreting \nan identical religious exemption\u2014rejected the argu-\nment that a Jewish school was not operated \u201cprimarily \nfor religious purposes\u201d because \u201cits curriculum of reli-\ngious instruction was secondary to secular subjects \ntaught at the school.\u201d Czigler v. Administrator, 501 \nN.E.2d 56, 57 (Ohio Ct. App. 1985). Instead, the court \nexplained that the religious \u201cexemption is determined \nby the purpose of the existence and operation of the \nschool. If that purpose be primarily of a religious na-\nture, the exemption applies without regard to the pro-\nportion of time devoted to religious instruction.\u201d Ibid. \nIn other words, \u201c[t]he test is not the activities but the \npurpose for which they are operated and conducted.\u201d \nId. at 58. That decision \u201cavoid[ed] potentially serious \nentanglement by the state in violation of the Estab-\nlishment Clause of the First Amendment\u201d and pre-\nvented courts from \u201centering into the quagmire of pro-\nportionality of interference in religious affairs\u201d by fore-\nclosing consideration of the \u201crelative amount of reli-\ngious activity or instruction\u201d provided. Id. at 57-59. \n\n21 \n \nB. By contrast, four states now hold that \nstate agencies can review the activities of \na religious organization to determine \nwhether \nthey \nare \n\u201ctypical\u201d \nreligious \nbehavior without running afoul of the \nConstitution.  \nWith the addition of Wisconsin, the highest courts \nof four states now find themselves on the opposite side \nof the split. \nArkansas. The Arkansas Supreme Court, in an \nopinion cited below, expressly rejected the test used by \ncourts on the other side of the split, holding that a re-\nligious hospital operated by the Sisters of Charity was \nnot operated primarily for religious purposes. See Ter-\nwilliger v. St. Vincent Infirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d \n696, 699 (Ark. 1991) (\u201cWe disagree with the approach \ntaken in the Kendall case.\u201d). Despite acknowledging \nthat the religious hospital\u2019s \u201csole motivation may be \nreligious in nature,\u201d the court held that Saint Vin-\ncent\u2019s was not operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes because the hospital \u201cfunctioned as any other \nhospital in the area except in those areas prohibited \nby the Roman Catholic Church,\u201d id. at 697, 699, and \n\u201cno proselytizing takes place, and no religious require-\nments are involved in hiring and staffing decisions ex-\ncept with reference to 18 employees associated with \nthe chapel,\u201d id. at 699. In reaching its decision, the \ncourt relied on both Lemon and Meek. Id. at 698. \nColorado. In another decision cited below, the Col-\norado Supreme Court interpreted nearly identical \nstatutory language to reject a religious organization\u2019s \ntax exemption. See Samaritan Inst. v. Prince-Walker, \n883 P.2d 3, 7 (Colo. 1994). As the court explained, \nthere was no dispute that the Samaritan Institute\u2019s \n\n22 \n \n\u201cgoal  * * *  is to strengthen and build upon a person\u2019s \nfaith,\u201d that its \u201cmission statement is described in its \nby-laws as providing religious outlets \u2018for people under \nstress,\u2019\u201d and that it \u201cperceives itself as \u2018an extension of \nthe ministry of the various churches with which it is \naffiliated.\u2019\u201d Id. at 8. The court, however, concluded \nthat \u201c[t]he evidence indicates that the services pro-\nvided by the Institute are essentially secular,\u201d because \nthe \u201cInstitute does not evangelize or proselytize,\u201d and \n\u201ca counselee is not required to participate in any reli-\ngious discussion or activity.\u201d Ibid. Thus \u201c[b]ecause the \nservices offered are essentially secular, the Institute \ndoes not \u2018operate primarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u201d \nIbid. The court did not address any constitutional is-\nsues. \nMaryland. The Maryland Court of Appeals \nadopted a similar approach when a Lutheran high \nschool sought to qualify for an identical religious ex-\nemption. See Employment Sec. Admin. v. Baltimore \nLutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, 436 A.2d 481 (Md. 1981). \nInstead of crediting the apparently undisputed testi-\nmony from the school\u2019s principal that the school\u2019s \u201cpri-\nmary purpose is religious,\u201d the court instead articu-\nlated twelve factors for courts to independently assess, \nincluding the \u201c[e]xtent of encouragement of spiritual \ndevelopment,\u201d the [s]ource[ ] of financial support,\u201d the \n[c]omposition of student body,\u201d and the \u201c[d]egree of ac-\nademic freedom.\u201d Id. at 487-488. Applying these fac-\ntors, the court scrutinized the school\u2019s funding \nstreams, the number of credits devoted to \u201creligious \ntraining,\u201d the \u201cnature of the mandatory chapel ser-\nvices,\u201d and \u201cwhether the school subscribes to and fol-\nlows principles of academic freedom.\u201d Id. at 488-489. \nUltimately the court determined that even more evi-\ndence and \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d were necessary. Id. at \n\n23 \n \n490. The court chose not to address the constitutional \nissues presented. Id. at 484 n.2. \nOther courts. Some intermediate state appellate \ncourts have also joined this side of the split. In Cathe-\ndral Arts Project, Inc. v. Department of Econ. Oppor-\ntunity, a Florida court of appeals held that an arts \nministry controlled by the Episcopal Cathedral of \nJacksonville was not operated primarily for religious \npurposes, reasoning that \u201c[w]hile Appellant\u2019s motiva-\ntion may be religious in nature, its primary purpose in \noperating  * * *  is to give art instruction to underpriv-\nileged children.\u201d) 95 So.3d 970, 973 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. \n2012). The dissent noted that this outcome created a \nconstitutional \u201cCatch-22\u201d for the ministry. Id. at 976 \n(Swanson, J., dissenting). \nC. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe decision below violates the First Amendment \nby favoring some religions over others, entangling \ncourts in religious questions, and interfering with \nchurch autonomy. \n1. The \ndecision \nbelow \nfavors \nsome \nreligions over others. \nWisconsin\u2019s rule expressly discriminates among re-\nligious groups, violating both Religion Clauses. \u201cAt a \nminimum, the protections of the Free Exercise Clause \npertain if the law at issue discriminates against some \nor all religious beliefs[.]\u201d Church of Lukumi Babalu \nAye, Inc. v.

The court concluded that Catholic Charities\u2019 \nactivities were not religious because: \n \n5  \nThree Justices have indicated that the issue of denomina-\ntional favoritism is certworthy. See Roman Catholic Diocese of \nAlbany v. Emami, 142 S. Ct. 421 (2021); cf. Roman Catholic Dio-\ncese of Albany v. Harris, No. 24A90 (application granted July 26, \n2024). \n6  \nLarson was not decided under Lemon. Larson, 456 U.S. at \n252. \n\n25 \n \n\u2022 \u201c[Catholic Charities] and the sub-entities,  * * *  \nneither attempt to imbue program participants \nwith the Catholic faith nor supply any religious \nmaterials to program participants or employ-\nees.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cBoth employment with the organizations and \nservices offered by the organizations are open to \nall participants regardless of religion.\u201d \n\u2022 Catholic Charities and its sub-entities do not \nengage \u201cin worship services, religious outreach, \nceremony, or religious education.\u201d \nApp.29a-30a. Indeed, after assessing the \u201cnature\u201d of \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt concluded they were \u201cprimarily charitable and \nsecular,\u201d even though Catholic Charities views them \nas religious. App.29a-30a.7 \nBy penalizing Catholic Charities for engaging in \ncritical parts of its ministry (like serving those in need \nwithout proselytizing), Wisconsin did not treat Catho-\nlic Charities with religious neutrality. Instead, the \nstate denied Catholic Charities an exemption precisely \nbecause its religious beliefs and exercise differed from \nwhat the Wisconsin Supreme Court thought were \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. App.26a; see also App.79a \n \n7  \nFederal judges have also wrongly discounted religious moti-\nvation because secular charities provide similar services. See, \ne.g., Spencer v. World Vision, Inc., 633 F.3d 723, 764 (9th Cir. \n2011) (Berzon, J., dissenting) (\u201cvast majority of World Vision\u2019s \nwork consists of humanitarian relief\u201d rather than \u201cexplicitly \nChristian work\u201d so it ought not qualify as \u201creligious\u201d under Title \nVII). But see id. at 741 (O\u2019Scannlain, J., concurring) (World Vi-\nsion \u201cprimarily religious\u201d because its \u201chumanitarian relief efforts \nflow from a profound sense of religious mission\u201d). \n\n26 \n \n(Grassl Bradley, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe majority actu-\nally inquires whether Catholic Charities\u2019 activities are \nstereotypically religious.\u201d). That wrongly disfavors \nthose religious traditions that ask believers to care for \nthe poor without strings attached.  \nSecond, Wisconsin\u2019s rule also violates the bedrock \nprinciple of neutrality among religions by discriminat-\ning against religious groups with more complex poli-\nties. The Diocese of Superior operates Petitioners as \nseparately incorporated ministries that carry out \nChrist\u2019s command to help the needy. But if Catholic \nCharities were not separately incorporated, it would \nbe exempt. App.166a (\u201cthe result in this case would \nlikely be different if [Catholic Charities] and its sub-\nentities were actually run by the church\u201d). Thus Wis-\nconsin penalizes the Catholic Church for organizing it-\nself as a group of separate corporate bodies in accord-\nance with Catholic teaching on subsidiarity, while \nother religious entities that include a variety of minis-\ntries as part of a single body are unaffected. That pen-\nalty on the Church\u2019s religiously determined polity vio-\nlates the Religion Clauses\u2019 rule against discrimination \namong religions. Cf. Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 528-531 (2021) (treating separately in-\ncorporated Catholic Social Services as part of Archdi-\nocese). And that makes LIRC\u2019s determination to cut off \nCatholic Charities from the Diocese of Superior all the \nmore baffling.8 \n \n8  \nWisconsin cannot hope to meet strict scrutiny, as it has no \nlegitimate, much less compelling, reason for discriminating \nagainst Catholic Charities. Although fully briefed by the parties, \nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court did not address strict scrutiny. \n\n27 \n \n2. The decision below entangles courts in \nreligious questions. \nThis Court has repeatedly confirmed that the Reli-\ngion Clauses forbid courts from entangling themselves \nin religious questions. See, e.g., Carson v. Makin, 596 \nU.S. 767, 787 (2022) (citing Our Lady of Guadalupe \nSch. v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 761 (2020)) (\u201cse-\nrious concerns\u201d under the First Amendment \u201cabout \nstate entanglement with religion\u201d); Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 761 (courts must avoid \u201cjudicial entanglement \nin religious issues\u201d); New York v. Cathedral Acad., 434 \nU.S. 125, 133 (1977) (\u201cprospect of church and state lit-\nigating in court about what does or does not have reli-\ngious meaning touches the very core of the constitu-\ntional guarantee\u201d); Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n, 397 U.S. 664, \n679 (1970) (examining \u201centanglement\u201d within \u201chistor-\nical frame of reference.\u201d) \nAnd almost nothing could be more entangling than \nsecond-guessing a church\u2019s answers to religious ques-\ntions\u2014including what constitutes religious activity. \nAs this Court explained in Amos, \u201cit is a significant \nburden on a religious organization to require it, on \npain of substantial liability, to predict which of its ac-\ntivities a secular court will consider religious.\u201d Corpo-\nration of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 336 \n(1987). Avoiding this inquiry \u201calleviate[s] significant \ngovernmental interference with the ability of religious \norganizations to define and carry out their religious \nmissions.\u201d Id. at 335. \nThe decision below runs afoul of this fundamental \nprinciple by requiring Wisconsin agencies and courts \nto conduct an intrusive inquiry into the internal af-\nfairs of religious organizations seeking the (h)(2) ex-\n\n28 \n \nemption. See, e.g., App.165a-166a. That kind of de-\ntailed inquisition into the beliefs, practices, and oper-\nations of a religious body will always entangle Church \nand State. \nIndeed, the court\u2019s mode of analysis\u2014examining \nwhether individual activities of religious nonprofits \nare \u201cinherently\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d religious in nature\u2014is \na recipe for hopeless entanglement. The court decided \nthat Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactivities are primarily charitable \nand secular,\u201d and that their ministry is a \u201cwholly sec-\nular endeavor\u201d despite Catholic Charities\u2019 uncontested \nbelief that its charitable ministry \u201cis part of [its] mis-\nsion to \u2018carry on the redeeming work of our Lord by \nreflecting gospel values and the moral teaching of the \nchurch.\u2019\u201d App.29a-30a. To reach this result, the court \nmade itself the arbiter of which of a church\u2019s actions \nare \u201cprimarily religious in nature,\u201d App.29a, and in-\nvented criteria for second-guessing a church\u2019s religious \nbelief that what it did was filled with religious pur-\npose. App.26a-27a (listing criteria). Cf. Amos, 483 U.S. \nat 343-344 (Brennan, J., and Marshall, J., concurring) \n(\u201cA case-by-case analysis for all activities therefore \nwould both produce excessive government entangle-\nment with religion and create the danger of chilling \nreligious activity.\u201d); Carson, 596 U.S. at 787 (\u201cscruti-\nnizing whether and how a religious school pursues its \neducational mission\u201d is off-limits). \nThe Wisconsin court thus went badly astray when \nit assumed simple lines could be drawn between \u201cpri-\nmarily religious\u201d activities and secular ones where an \nentire institution is imbued with religious purpose. \nSee Amos, 483 U.S. at 336. Indeed, the court\u2019s criteria, \nsuch as assessing whether a religious organization \nserves or employs only co-religionists or conducts \n\n29 \n \n\u201cworship services, religious outreach, ceremony, or re-\nligious education,\u201d App.29a, will inevitably thrust \ncourts into a constitutional thicket. See Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 761.  \nWorse still, Wisconsin\u2019s approach also requires \ncourts to second-guess churches\u2019 motivations. Indeed, \nthe Wisconsin Court of Appeals admitted it was reject-\ning Catholic Charities\u2019 view of the religious signifi-\ncance of its actions, recognizing that if it looked at \nCatholic Charities\u2019 purpose for engaging in these ac-\ntions, it would likely have come to a different conclu-\nsion. App.165a-166a; App.225a-227a. Forcing govern-\nment agencies and courts to conduct an ongoing inqui-\nsition into church activities is the opposite of separa-\ntion of church and state. \n3. The decision below interferes with \nchurch autonomy. \nThe United States Constitution guarantees reli-\ngious bodies \u201cindependence from secular control or \nmanipulation, in short, power to decide for them-\nselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernment as well as those of faith and doctrine.\u201d \nKedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94, 116 \n(1952). That \u201cgeneral principle of church autonomy,\u201d \nprotects among other things churches\u2019 \u201cautonomy with \nrespect to internal management decisions.\u201d Our Lady, \n591 U.S. at 746-747. In Kedroff, the New York Legis-\nlature attempted to separate certain Russian Ortho-\ndox churches it viewed as Communist-controlled \u201cfrom \nthe central governing hierarchy of the Russian Ortho-\ndox Church, the Patriarch of Moscow and the Holy \nSynod\u201d and transfer control to a U.S.-based Russian \nOrthodox denomination. Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 107. This \nCourt rejected this governmental effort to divide sub-\n\n30 \n \nentities from their larger church body. Id. at 116; see \nalso Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 \nU.S. 696, 721 (1976) (\u201creorganization of the Diocese in-\nvolves a matter of internal church government, an is-\nsue at the core of ecclesiastical affairs\u201d); Kreshik v. \nSaint Nicholas Cathedral, 363 U.S. 190, 191 (1960) \n(Kedroff also applies to judicial determinations). \nWisconsin\u2019s discriminatory rule violates the church \nautonomy doctrine for at least two reasons. First, Wis-\nconsin\u2019s approach interferes with matters of church \ngovernment and organization. By penalizing Petition-\ners because they are organized as separately incorpo-\nrated bodies in accordance with the Catholic principle \nof subsidiarity, Wisconsin has put a gigantic thumb on \nthe religious polity scale for all religious institutions. \nSecond, Wisconsin does not credit activities that \ncould be \u201cprovided by organizations of either religious \nor secular motivations\u201d as religious. App.30a. That \nmirrors the government\u2019s error in Hosanna-Tabor \nEvangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, \nwhere it demanded that a minister\u2019s activities be \u201cex-\nclusively religious\u201d to merit protection. 565 U.S. 171, \n193 (2012). And just as \u201cmanag[ing] the congregation\u2019s \nfinances\u201d or \u201csupervising purely secular personnel,\u201d \ndid not make a minister\u2019s efforts nonreligious, ibid., \nproviding \u201cbackground support and management ser-\nvices\u201d is anything but a \u201cwholly secular endeavor.\u201d \nApp.30a. \n* * * \nWisconsin\u2019s rule is both absurd and harmful. Ab-\nsurd, because it can logically lead to the conclusion \nthat the charitable arm of a Catholic diocese is not op-\n\n31 \n \nerated for religious purposes. Harmful, because it dis-\ncriminates against religious organizations that help \npeople outside their group without proselytizing. \nWorse yet, the rule takes away resources that would \notherwise be used to help the poor and the needy. The \nCourt should intervene to resolve the split and remove \nthis burden on the free exercise of religious institu-\ntions in states across the country. \nII. The decision below also deepens a split \namong lower courts over whether federal \nconstitutional violations must be proven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nThe decision below also exacerbates an existing \nsplit among the lower courts over the burden of proof \nfor federal constitutional claims. \nA. Federal courts apply a \u201cplain showing\u201d or \n\u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d burden of proof to \nfederal constitutional claims. \nIn most modern cases raising constitutional chal-\nlenges to statutes, federal courts simply apply the rel-\nevant doctrinal standards without any reference to a \nburden of proving unconstitutionality. See, e.g., Car-\nson, 596 U.S. at 778-781; R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 \nU.S. 377, 381-386 (1992). Where they articulate a spe-\ncific standard, federal courts employ a \u201cplain showing\u201d \nor \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d standard. E.g., United \nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000); Missis-\nsippi Comm\u2019n on Env\u2019t Quality v. EPA, 790 F.3d 138, \n182-183 (D.C. Cir. 2015); United States v. Brunner, \n726 F.3d 299, 303 (2d Cir. 2013). \nFor its part, this Court has used the phrase \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cbeyond a rational doubt\u201d \nonly five times, and only twice as part of a holding. See \n\n32 \n \nLegal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. 457, 531 (1870) (dicta); \nSinking-Fund Cases, 99 U.S. 700, 718 (1878) (dicta); \nPowell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, 684 (1888) (hold-\ning); Federal Housing Admin. v. Darlington, Inc., 358 \nU.S. 84, 91 (1958) (holding); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 \nU.S. 7, 10 (1975) (dicta).  \nThe \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard has, of \ncourse, its roots in criminal law. See James Q. Whit-\nman, The Origins of Reasonable Doubt 114-123 (2008) \n(discussing history of standard in the twelfth and thir-\nteenth century). In the nineteenth century, jurists be-\ngan to sporadically use the term outside the criminal \ncontext, though never as \u201ca rule that the relevant \ncourts actually applied.\u201d Hugh Spitzer, Reasoning v. \nRhetoric: The Strange Case of \u201cUnconstitutional Be-\nyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d, 74 Rutgers U. L. Rev. 1429, \n1437 (2022). \nLaw Professor James Bradley Thayer advocated \nfor broader adoption of the standard to limit perceived \njudicial activism. See James Bradley Thayer, The \nOrigin and Scope of the American Doctrine of Consti-\ntutional Law, 7 Harv. L. Rev. 129, 151 (1893) (advo-\ncating for broad adoption of \u201cbeyond a reasonable \ndoubt\u201d standard). Though some courts and scholars \nembraced it, Thayer\u2019s theory never garnered any pur-\nchase in this Court. See Spitzer, Reasoning, 74 Rut-\ngers U. L. Rev. at 1438 (\u201cThe Supreme Court never se-\nriously entertained \u2018unconstitutional beyond a reason-\nable doubt\u2019 as a working standard.\u201d). It last appeared \nas dictum, 50 years ago, in a quotation of the underly-\ning state court opinion. Stanton, 421 U.S. at 11. The \n\u201cunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard is thus \u201cdead\u201d in federal courts. Richard A. Posner, \n\n33 \n \nThe Rise and Fall of Judicial Self-Restraint, 100 Cal. \nL. Rev. 519, 544, 553 (2012). \nB. Some state courts continue to use \u201cbeyond \na reasonable doubt\u201d as a working standard \nfor deciding federal constitutional claims. \nForty-nine states have used this standard in opin-\nions since 1893, though its use has dwindled over time. \nSee Christopher R. Green, Clarity and Reasonable \nDoubt in Early State-Constitutional Review, 57 S. Tex. \nL. Rev. 169, 179-182 nn.102-150 (2015) (collecting \nstate cases); Spitzer, Reasoning, 74 Rutgers U. L. Rev. \nat 1440-1441 nn.70-73 (tracking state usage over last \ntwo decades). In most cases the phrase is \u201c\u2018simply a \nhortatory expression\u2019 when the justices are really say-\ning that they respect the legislature\u2019s role.\u201d Id. at 1460 \n(citation omitted). \nBy contrast, at least five states, including Wiscon-\nsin, actively apply the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \nstandard to dispose of federal constitutional claims.  \nColorado. Colorado applies \u201cthe burden of proving \n[a statute] unconstitutional beyond a reasonable \ndoubt\u201d to allegations \u201cthat a statute infringes on first \namendment freedoms.\u201d People v. Ford, 773 P.2d 1059, \n1062 (Colo. 1989). See also Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d \n1270, 1284-1286 (Colo.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 959 \n(1993) (employing \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard to decide federal Equal Protection claim). \nConnecticut. Connecticut also employs the stand-\nard. For example, it used \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \nto reject a Takings Clause claim regarding condemna-\ntion of property for economic development by private \nparties. Kelo v. City of New London, 843 A.2d 500, 536 \n(Conn. 2004), affirmed, 545 U.S. 469 (2005). \n\n34 \n \nHawaii. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Hawaii \nhas applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d burden of \nproof to eminent domain challenges. Housing Fin. & \nDev. Corp. v. Castle, 898 P.2d 576, 602 (Haw. 1995). \nMontana. Montana requires claimants to prove \nstatutes unconstitutional \u201cbeyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d For instance, it applied the standard when an-\nalyzing whether a state tax transgressed equal protec-\ntion and due process rights. Powder River County v. \nState, 60 P.3d 357, 373-377 (Mont. 2002). \nWisconsin. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has re-\npeatedly applied the standard. See, e.g., In re Termi-\nnation of Parental Rts., 694 N.W.2d 344, 350-355 (Wis. \n2005) (federal Due Process challenge to termination of \nparental rights) In re Mental Commitment of Christo-\npher S., 878 N.W.2d 109, 120-126 (Wis. 2016) (federal \nDue Process challenge to commitment of inmate to \nmental health facility); State v. Smith, 780 N.W.2d 90, \n95-105 (Wis. 2010) (federal Equal Protection and Due \nProcess challenge to sex offender registration statute); \nSociety Ins. v. LIRC, 786 N.W.2d 385, 402, 404 (Wis. \n2010) (federal Due Process and Contract Clause chal-\nlenge to retroactive application of workers\u2019 compensa-\ntion statute). And here, the court reiterated the stand-\nard seven times, relying heavily on this burden of proof \n(over the dissent\u2019s objections) to reject Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 constitutional claims. App.7a, 37a, 44a, 47a, 50a, \n51a. \nC. \u201cBeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is the wrong \nstandard for federal constitutional claims. \nIn criminal cases, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is \u201ca \nprime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions \nresting on factual error.\u201d In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, \n\n35 \n \n363 (1970). But it is entirely misplaced when it comes \nto constitutional guarantees because the Constitution \nprovides \u201cno textual support\u201d for applying it outside \nthe criminal context. Island County v. State, 955 P.2d \n377, 384 (Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring). If an-\nything, allowing state courts to give shorter shrift to \nenumerated federal constitutional rights contravenes \nthe text of the Supremacy Clause.  \nWhat\u2019s worse, applying the standard threatens \nconstitutional rights. The \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \nstandard is, by nature, a presumption, which means \nthere will be \u201coccasions\u201d when the standard is \u201cdeter-\nminative.\u201d Island County, 955 P.2d at 388 (Sanders, \nJ., concurring). As a result, a constitutional challenge \nmight fail in a state courthouse in Milwaukee when \nthe same challenge would prevail in the federal court-\nhouse down the street.  \nMoreover, application of this standard to constitu-\ntional claims is inconsistent with modern judicial \nmethodologies. \u201cNo originalist, or any other judge com-\nmitted to a constitutional theory\u201d can embrace the \nstandard. Posner, Rise and Fall, 100 Cal. L. Rev. at \n537. That is because such theories are premised on the \nnotion that there are identifiable answers to constitu-\ntional questions. \u201c[T]he Constitution, unlike eviden-\ntiary proof of a fact, does not operate on a continuum.\u201d \nState v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d 323, 343 (Ohio 2022) \n(DeWine, J., concurring). Cf. Loper Bright Enters. v. \nRaimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2271 (2024) (deference in-\nappropriate because statutes have meaning \u201cneces-\nsarily discernible by a court deploying its full interpre-\ntive toolkit\u201d). So \u201c[w]hen a law contravenes the consti-\ntution, it is [a court\u2019s] duty to say so.\u201d Mayo v. Wiscon-\nsin Injured Patients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 \n\n36 \n \nN.W.2d 678, 702 (Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., con-\ncurring).  \nIt may be better that \u201cten guilty persons escape, \nthan the one innocent suffer.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, \nCommentaries 352. But \u201c[i]t is not better, that the Con-\nstitution should be violated ninety and nine times by \nthe Legislature than, that the courts should errone-\nously hold one act of the Legislature unconstitutional.\u201d \nVarner v. Martin, 21 W. Va. 534, 542 (1883).  \nIII. This case is an ideal vehicle. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle for resolving the \nquestions presented. The first question presented was \nfully and finally litigated through six layers of review, \nfrom the Department of Workforce Development to the \nWisconsin Supreme Court. That leaves only the fed-\neral questions passed on below to be decided by this \nCourt. Moreover, there is an ample record on which to \npredicate a decision. \nWith respect to the second question presented, alt-\nhough the Wisconsin Supreme Court was the first in \nthis litigation to invoke the \u201cbeyond a reasonable \ndoubt\u201d standard, it relied on it heavily in reaching its \njudgment. That standard is therefore squarely before \nthis Court. \nAnd without this Court\u2019s intervention, the splits \nare unlikely to resolve themselves. In particular, this \ncase is the cleanest vehicle for addressing the \u201creli-\ngious purposes\u201d split to arrive at the Court since St. \nMartin and Grace Brethren were decided. The Court \nshould therefore take the opportunity to set this im-\nportant area of law onto a firmer\u2014and constitution-\nally sounder\u2014footing. \n\n37 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C.

While the thought itself doesn't contain the case arguments, it is the necessary cognitive step to unlock that information, making it extremely valuable for completing the task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): The action demonstrates a crucial self-correction and learning loop. The agent is not just trying another random search; it's analyzing why the previous one failed and developing a more robust, generalizable search heuristic. The strategy of broadening a keyword search ('petition') while using metadata filters ('main document') is a powerful and reusable technique for navigating the document system in any future case. This significantly improves the agent's general methodology for information retrieval.\n\nJoint EIG (1.6): The action is a textbook example of effective reasoning.

Rev. 1429, (2022) ................ 23, 24 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis case involves an effort by Catholic Charities \nof the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin, and four \nindependently incorporated sub-entities of Catholic \nCharities to obtain a state statutory exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions on the \ngrounds that they are \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes.\u201d They argue the First Amendment \ncompels this result. \n \nNo split of authority among the states\u2019 supreme \ncourts exists on that constitutional question, and the \nWisconsin Supreme Court decision does not directly \nconflict with the decision of any federal circuit or state \nhigh court. All courts look to some degree at the \noperations of the group seeking an exemption; none \nsimply grant the exemption solely based on the \ngroup\u2019s assertion that its activities are religiously \nmotivated. On the merits, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt correctly declined to hold that the First \nAmendment \nentitles \nPetitioners \nto \nthis \ntax \nexemption.  \n \nLikewise, no split of authority exists regarding the \npresumption of constitutionality afforded to statutes \nwhen their validity is challenged. The variations \nPetitioners identify are rhetorical, not substantive. \nAnd even if a split existed, Petitioners did not raise \nthis issue at any level below and therefore it was not \nsufficiently developed to warrant this Court\u2019s review.  \n \nThe petition for certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nWisconsin \nestablished \nits \nunemployment \ncompensation system in 1932, the first in the Nation. \nApp. 14a. It enacted its law, codified today in Wis. \nStat. ch. 108, to \u201cavoid the risk or hazards that will \nbefall those, who, because of employment, are \ndependent upon others for their livelihood.\u201d App. 14a. \nThe law collects \u201climited funds from a large number \nof employers, particularly during periods of stable \nemployment, then pay[s] out benefits during periods \nof high unemployment from the funds that have been \naccumulated.\u201d App. 14a. \n \nGenerally, any service performed for pay for a \npublic, private, or nonprofit employer is covered by \nChapter 108. App. 15a. But some services are \nstatutorily exempt. Relevant here, Wisconsin law \nexempts paid service \u201cin the employ of an \norganization \noperated \nprimarily \nfor \nreligious \npurposes and operated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nPetitioners seek that exemption here. \n \nCatholic Charities states that it provides services \nto the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the \nsocial ministry of the Catholic church in the Diocese \nof Superior and that its \u201cpurpose . . . is to be an \neffective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d App. 7a. It also \nstates that its religious mission requires it to offer \nservices to all in need, not just those of the Catholic \nfaith. App. 7a. \n \nCatholic Charities offers various charitable \nservices partly through four separately incorporated \nsub-entities, the other Petitioners in this case: \n\n3 \n \n\u2022 Barron County Developmental Services, Inc., \nprovides job placement, job coaching, and an \n\u201carray of services to assist individuals with \ndisabilities \n[to] \nget \nemployment \nin \nthe \ncommunity.\u201d This company had no religious \naffiliation until it joined Catholic Charities in \n2014. App. 8a. \n\u2022 Black River Industries, Inc. provides job \ntraining and daily living services to people with \ndevelopmental or mental health disabilities, as \nwell as those with a limited income. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. \n\u2022 Diversified \nServices, \nInc. \nprovides  \nwork \nopportunities \nto \nindividuals \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. App. 9a.  \n\u2022 Headwaters, Inc., provides services for people \nwith disabilities including training related to \nactivities of daily living and employment, and \nprovides Head Start home visitation services. \nApp. 9a. \n \nPeople receiving services from these organizations \nreceive no religious training or orientation, and none \nof them attempts to \u201cinculcate the Catholic faith.\u201d \nApp. 10a. Employees need not ascribe to any religious \nfaith. App. 10a. \n \nNone of the sub-entities receives funding from the \nDiocese of Superior. Barron County Development \nServices, \nInc. \ncontracts \nwith \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development\u2019s Division of \nVocational Rehabilitation to provide its services. App. \n8a. Black River Industries, Inc.\u2019s funding comes \nlargely from county and state government. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. Diversified Services, Inc. receives its funding from \n\n4 \n \nFamily Care, a Medicaid long-term care program,  \nand private contracts. App. 9a. And Headwaters, Inc.  \nis funded primarily through government contracts.  \nApp. 9a. \n \nCatholic Charities has participated in Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment insurance program since 1972, when \nit submitted a form describing the nature of its \noperations \nas \n\u201ccharitable,\u201d \n\u201ceducational,\u201d \nand \n\u201crehabilitative,\u201d not \u201creligious.\u201d App. 10a. The state \nagency then administering the uninsurance program \ndetermined that Catholic Charities was subject to the \nunemployment insurance law. App. 10a.  \n \nIn 2015, a Wisconsin trial court determined that a \nsub-entity of Catholic Charities that is not part of this \ncase was eligible for the religious purposes exception \nin Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 10a. After that \nruling, Catholic Charities and the four sub-entities \nsought \na \ndetermination \nfrom \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development, which \nadministers the unemployment compensation system \ntoday, that they too are exempt. App. 10a\u201311a. \n \nThe Department denied Petitioners\u2019 request to \nwithdraw from the program because it determined \nthat they had not established that they are  \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the  \nmeaning of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 11a.  \nAn administrative law judge reversed that decision,  \nbut the final agency decisionmaker, the Labor  \nand Industry Review Commission, affirmed the \nDepartment\u2019s determination. 11a. On judicial review, \nthe trial court for Douglas County reversed in \nPetitioners\u2019 favor, but the court of appeals and \nWisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Labor and \n\n5 \n \nIndustry Review Commission\u2019s decision. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the court \nof appeals\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin law. It held \nthat the Commission had correctly interpreted Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., including by reasoning that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered \nin a determination of whether an organization is \n\u2018operated primarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u201d App. 21a\u2013\n22a. In other words, the statute required an \u201cobjective \nexamination of [Petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to \ndetermine whether those activities are \u201csecular in \nnature\u201d such that Petitioners are \u201cnot operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u201d App. 32a\u201333a. \n \nApplying that statutory construction to the \norganizations, the court concluded that Petitioners \ndid not qualify for the religious exemption for two \nmain reasons: (1) they did not seek to imbue \nparticipants with the Catholic faith and provided \nparticipants with no religious materials (App. 29a); \nand (2) their activities were primarily charitable  \nand secular (App. 30a), as illustrated by how the  \nactivities of one of the sub-entities, Barron County \nDevelopment Services, Inc., had not changed after it \naffiliated with Catholic Charities (App. 30a\u201331a). The \ncourt noted how this result was consistent with \ncongressional \nhistory \nof \nthe \nparallel \nfederal \nunemployment law, which indicated that \u201can \norphanage or a home for the aged\u201d would not qualify \nas being \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nsimply by virtue of being \u201crelated\u201d to a church. \nApp. 30a. \n\n6 \n \n \nThe court also rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments \nunder the First Amendment, concluding that the \nstatute violated neither the Establishment Clause, \nthe church autonomy principle, nor the Free Exercise \nClause.  \n \nAs to the Establishment Clause, the court held \nthat the statutorily required \u201cneutral and secular \ninquiry\u201d into Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities\u201d (App. \n40a\u201341a) does not improperly \u201ccross into an \nevaluation of religious dogma\u201d (App. 38a\u201339a). \nRather, that objective analysis is consistent with the \ninquiry needed for any religious tax exemption laws, \nwhich have been recognized as valid throughout \nAmerican history. App. 41a\u201344a. And the court held \nthat the statute did not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it neither \u201cregulate[d] internal \nchurch governance nor mandate[d] any activity.\u201d App. \n45a\u201346a. Last, the law did not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise \nrights \nbecause \nimposing \na \ngenerally \napplicable tax is not a constitutionally significant \nburden. App. 48a\u201350a. \n \nPetitioners then filed a petition for writ of \ncertiorari with this Court. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n \nWhile Petitioners would like an exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions, they \nhave not satisfied this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari. \nThe state courts are not split on Petitioners\u2019 First \nAmendment challenges, and Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme \nCourt correctly resolved those challenges, in any \nevent. Likewise, there is no state court split on the \nburden for challenges to the validity of state statutes. \n\n7 \n \nAnd even if there was, this case is a poor vehicle to \nresolve it because the issue was not raised below. \nI. \nCertiorari should be denied on the first \nquestion presented. \n \nThis Court should deny the petition on Petitioners\u2019 \nfirst question: whether the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption \nin \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., \nas \ninterpreted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, violates \nthe First Amendment.  \n \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, there is no split \nof authority among the state supreme courts on the \nFirst Amendment claims they present. The many \nstate court cases they discuss consider only how to \ninterpret and apply similar statutory exemptions, not \nwhether those exemptions comply with the First \nAmendment. And Petitioners identify no federal \ncircuit spilt. Without any disagreement among the \nstate courts or lower federal courts, Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional arguments have not percolated enough \nto merit certiorari.  \n \nIn any event, the Wisconsin Supreme Court got it \nright. Courts routinely deny religious tax exemptions \nto entities that assert religious motivations without \noverly entangling themselves in religious matters. \nThat effort does not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it does not regulate internal church \ngovernance or compel any activity. And the \nunemployment tax does not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise rights: it imposes no constitutionally \nsignificant burden on their religious exercise, and it is \na general law that is neutral and nondiscriminatory \non questions of religious belief.  \n\n8 \n \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on  \nthe First Amendment questions \nPetitioner presents. \n \nPetitioners identify no split on the question of \nwhether states may constitutionally consider an \nemployer\u2019s operations, not just its motivations,  \nin deciding whether it is entitled to a religious \nexemption from a state\u2019s unemployment insurance \ntax system.  \n \n1. No high courts have addressed the First \nAmendment issues Petitioners raise here, let alone in \na way that creates a split. \n \nPetitioners cite seven other state high court cases, \nbut \nthose \ncases \nall \ninvolve \nstate \nstatutory \ninterpretation issues, not First Amendment ones. The \ncases all confront similar interpretation questions \nbecause the states copied the language of a federal \nstatute, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), \nwhich establishes a cooperative federal-state program \nof benefits to unemployed workers. See St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. S. Dakota, 451 U.S. \n772, 775 & n.3 (1981); Comm. Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 287 (Iowa 1982). \nFUTA\u2014like \nstate \nstatutes \ncopying \nit\u2014allows \nqualified state unemployment programs to exclude \nnon-profit employers from coverage as to services \nperformed: \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or \n(B) an organization which is operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and which \nis operated, supervised, controlled, or \n\n9 \n \nprincipally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches . . . . \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b).  \n \nBecause many states have adopted that language, \nmultiple state high court decisions discuss what it \nmeans and how to apply it as a matter of state law. \nThat is the issue presented in the cases cited by \nPetitioners\u2014not \nwhether \nthose \nstate \nstatutes \ncomplied with the First Amendment.  \n \nBegin with the four states that Petitioners \nhighlight as supposedly \u201cfocus[ing] on whether an \norganization has sincere religious beliefs indicating \nthat the purpose of its activities is rooted in religious \nmotivation.\u201d Pet. 16. None of them issued a First \nAmendment holding. \n \nIdaho. \nIn \nDepartment \nof \nEmployment \nv. \nChampion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1372 \n(Idaho 1979), Idaho\u2019s high court found only that an \nagency had \u201cerred in its application of the Idaho \nunemployment security law.\u201d It said nothing about \nthe First Amendment. And, as Petitioners candidly \nadmit, Nampa Christian Schools Foundation v. State \nof Idaho, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) relied on \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d and \u201cdid not reach any \nconstitutional questions.\u201d Pet. 17. \n \nIowa. Petitioners also concede that Community \nLutheran School v. Iowa Department of Job Service, \n326 N.W.2d 286 (Iowa 1982) \u201cdid not need to reach\u201d \nany First Amendment questions. Pet. 17. But \nPetitioners\u2019 suggestion that the court construed the \nstatute to \u201cavoid constitutional issues\u201d is inaccurate. \nPet. 17. The court applied ordinary statutory \ninterpretation principles and then, after doing so, \n\n10 \n \nnoted that it did not need to resolve any First \nAmendment questions because it had granted the \nemployer an exemption as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation. Cmty. Lutheran, 326 N.W.2d at 291\u2013\n92. \n \nMaine. In Schwartz v. Unemployment Insurance \nCommission, 895 A.2d 965, 970\u201371 (Me. 2006), \nMaine\u2019s high court never mentioned the First \nAmendment \nand \ninstead \nexamined \nwhether \n\u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d supported a \nfinding of \u201cprimarily religious\u201d purposes.  \n \nMassachusetts. Massachusetts\u2019 high court found \nthat an organization \u201csatisfie[d] the[ ] statutory \nrequirements\u201d of religious purpose. Kendall v. Dir. of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198\u2013200 (Mass. \n1985). In passing, the court mentioned that the \ndefault of construing tax exemptions against the \ntaxpayer does not apply when the \u201cfree exercise of \nreligion\u201d is at issue, id. at 199, but the court never \nfurther analyzed whether denying the exemption \nwould have violated the First Amendment.  \n \nThen turn to the three states (excluding \nWisconsin) that supposedly embody the \u201copposite side \nof the split.\u201d Pet. 21. Like the first four, none of these \nissued a First Amendment holding. \n \nArkansas. Arkansas\u2019 high court denied a \nreligious purpose exemption to a Catholic-affiliated \nhospital based on the court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the \nstatute in a manner separating motivation from \npurpose of operation.\u201d Terwilliger v. St. Vincent \nInfirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Ark. 1991). \nAs Petitioners note, the case cited Lemon v. \nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) and Meek v. \n\n11 \n \nPittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975) once in passing (Pet Br. \n21), but it engaged in no First Amendment analysis \nwhatsoever. \n \nColorado. Petitioners acknowledge that the \nColorado high court in Samaritan Institute v. Prince-\nWalker, 883 P.2d 3 (Colo. 1994) \u201cdid not address any \nconstitutional issues.\u201d Pet. 22. Instead, it addressed \nwhether the lower court had \u201cproperly interpreted the \nphrase \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019\u201d \nand denied the exemption to a counseling center. \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 4. \n \nMaryland. Again, Petitioners concede that \nMaryland\u2019s high court in Employment Security \nAssociation v. Lutheran High School Association,  \n436 A.2d 481 (Md. 1981) \u201cchose not to address the \nconstitutional issues presented.\u201d Pet. 23. Like the \nothers, the court instead addressed what \u201cfactors may \nappropriately be taken into account\u201d in the religious \npurposes analysis. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, 436 \nA.2d at 487.1 \n \n1 The intermediate state appellate court decisions \nPetitioners cite on both sides of the \u201csplit\u201d likewise did  \nnot involve First Amendment holdings. See By The Hand  \nClub for Kids, NFP, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Emp. Sec., 188 N.E.3d  \n1196, 1198, 1214 (Ill. App. 2020) (evaluating whether  \nreligious afterschool program qualified for Illinois\u2019  \nexemption without \u201creach[ing] the parties\u2019 constitutional \narguments\u201d); Cathedral Arts Project, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Econ. \nOpportunity, 95 So.3d 970, 973 (Fla. App. 2012) \n(examining whether children\u2019s art program qualified for \nFlorida\u2019s exemption); Czigler v. Administrator, 501 N.E.2d \n56, 57 (Ohio App. 1985) (evaluating whether religious \nschool qualified for Ohio\u2019s exemption and mentioning only \n\n12 \n \n \nBecause there is no split on a federal question, \ncertiorari should be denied. This Court does not \nresolve questions of how states interpret their own \nlaws. See Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916 (1997) \n(\u201cNeither this Court nor any other federal tribunal \nhas any authority to place a construction on a state \nstatute different from the one rendered by the highest \ncourt of the State.\u201d). \n \n2. Even on the statutory interpretation question \nof how to construe and apply the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption, the split that Petitioners posit does not \nreally exist. \n \nAmong the cases Petitioners describe as residing \non their side of the ledger (Pet. 16\u201320), it is true that \nthe courts held the entities were operated \u201cprimarily \nfor a religious purpose\u201d and thus entitled to the \nstatutory exemption. But that is because the specific \nfacts in those four cases justified this result, not \nbecause the courts applied a different test from the \nones on Respondents\u2019 side of the ledger. More to the \npoint, none of the cases on Petitioners\u2019 side looked at \nthe entity\u2019s motivation alone\u2014they all also looked to \nsome degree at the entity\u2019s activities, just like \nWisconsin\u2019s supreme court did here. \n \nIdaho. In Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., the \nIdaho court held that services provided by students at \na religious college in a church-run bakery qualified for \nthe exemption because it was part of their religious \ntraining; services provided by regular fulltime \nemployees at the same bakery did not qualify.  \n \nin passing \u201cpotentially serious entanglement by the state \nin violation of the Establishment Clause\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n592 P.2d at 1371\u201372. And in Nampa Christian \nSchools Foundation, the Idaho Supreme Court held \nthat the statutory language required the court to look \nat an organization\u2019s operations, not just its \nmotivations. 719 P.2d at 1180. \n \nIowa. In Community Lutheran School, the court \nlooked at the operations of the school, including the \nincorporation of Lutheran faith into \u201cevery aspect of \nall classes.\u201d 326 N.W. 2d at 291. The curriculum \ninvolved \u201c[s]pecific religious instruction,\u201d \u201creligious \nceremonies [were] held throughout the day,\u201d and \nteachers had to be Lutherans. Id. The school was not \nengaged in otherwise secular activity motivated by a \nreligious purpose. \n \nMaine. \nIn \nSchwartz, \nthe \ncourt \nexamined \noperational facts including how the entity \u201c[brought] \npastors to island communities to lead religious \nservices and provide religious counseling,\u201d paid for \nminister salaries, and had otherwise \u201cmaintained its \nreligious emphasis and function.\u201d 895 A.2d at 970. \n \nMassachusetts. In Kendall, the court rejected a \nrule that would grant exemptions only to schools \n\u201cdevoted to religious instruction.\u201d 473 N.E.2d at 199. \nBut the court noted how the school was \u201cope\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1429, (2022) ................ 23, 24 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis case involves an effort by Catholic Charities \nof the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin, and four \nindependently incorporated sub-entities of Catholic \nCharities to obtain a state statutory exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions on the \ngrounds that they are \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes.\u201d They argue the First Amendment \ncompels this result. \n \nNo split of authority among the states\u2019 supreme \ncourts exists on that constitutional question, and the \nWisconsin Supreme Court decision does not directly \nconflict with the decision of any federal circuit or state \nhigh court. All courts look to some degree at the \noperations of the group seeking an exemption; none \nsimply grant the exemption solely based on the \ngroup\u2019s assertion that its activities are religiously \nmotivated. On the merits, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt correctly declined to hold that the First \nAmendment \nentitles \nPetitioners \nto \nthis \ntax \nexemption.  \n \nLikewise, no split of authority exists regarding the \npresumption of constitutionality afforded to statutes \nwhen their validity is challenged. The variations \nPetitioners identify are rhetorical, not substantive. \nAnd even if a split existed, Petitioners did not raise \nthis issue at any level below and therefore it was not \nsufficiently developed to warrant this Court\u2019s review.  \n \nThe petition for certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nWisconsin \nestablished \nits \nunemployment \ncompensation system in 1932, the first in the Nation. \nApp. 14a. It enacted its law, codified today in Wis. \nStat. ch. 108, to \u201cavoid the risk or hazards that will \nbefall those, who, because of employment, are \ndependent upon others for their livelihood.\u201d App. 14a. \nThe law collects \u201climited funds from a large number \nof employers, particularly during periods of stable \nemployment, then pay[s] out benefits during periods \nof high unemployment from the funds that have been \naccumulated.\u201d App. 14a. \n \nGenerally, any service performed for pay for a \npublic, private, or nonprofit employer is covered by \nChapter 108. App. 15a. But some services are \nstatutorily exempt. Relevant here, Wisconsin law \nexempts paid service \u201cin the employ of an \norganization \noperated \nprimarily \nfor \nreligious \npurposes and operated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nPetitioners seek that exemption here. \n \nCatholic Charities states that it provides services \nto the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the \nsocial ministry of the Catholic church in the Diocese \nof Superior and that its \u201cpurpose . . . is to be an \neffective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d App. 7a. It also \nstates that its religious mission requires it to offer \nservices to all in need, not just those of the Catholic \nfaith. App. 7a. \n \nCatholic Charities offers various charitable \nservices partly through four separately incorporated \nsub-entities, the other Petitioners in this case: \n\n3 \n \n\u2022 Barron County Developmental Services, Inc., \nprovides job placement, job coaching, and an \n\u201carray of services to assist individuals with \ndisabilities \n[to] \nget \nemployment \nin \nthe \ncommunity.\u201d This company had no religious \naffiliation until it joined Catholic Charities in \n2014. App. 8a. \n\u2022 Black River Industries, Inc. provides job \ntraining and daily living services to people with \ndevelopmental or mental health disabilities, as \nwell as those with a limited income. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. \n\u2022 Diversified \nServices, \nInc. \nprovides  \nwork \nopportunities \nto \nindividuals \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. App. 9a.  \n\u2022 Headwaters, Inc., provides services for people \nwith disabilities including training related to \nactivities of daily living and employment, and \nprovides Head Start home visitation services. \nApp. 9a. \n \nPeople receiving services from these organizations \nreceive no religious training or orientation, and none \nof them attempts to \u201cinculcate the Catholic faith.\u201d \nApp. 10a. Employees need not ascribe to any religious \nfaith. App. 10a. \n \nNone of the sub-entities receives funding from the \nDiocese of Superior. Barron County Development \nServices, \nInc. \ncontracts \nwith \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development\u2019s Division of \nVocational Rehabilitation to provide its services. App. \n8a. Black River Industries, Inc.\u2019s funding comes \nlargely from county and state government. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. Diversified Services, Inc. receives its funding from \n\n4 \n \nFamily Care, a Medicaid long-term care program,  \nand private contracts. App. 9a. And Headwaters, Inc.  \nis funded primarily through government contracts.  \nApp. 9a. \n \nCatholic Charities has participated in Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment insurance program since 1972, when \nit submitted a form describing the nature of its \noperations \nas \n\u201ccharitable,\u201d \n\u201ceducational,\u201d \nand \n\u201crehabilitative,\u201d not \u201creligious.\u201d App. 10a. The state \nagency then administering the uninsurance program \ndetermined that Catholic Charities was subject to the \nunemployment insurance law. App. 10a.  \n \nIn 2015, a Wisconsin trial court determined that a \nsub-entity of Catholic Charities that is not part of this \ncase was eligible for the religious purposes exception \nin Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 10a. After that \nruling, Catholic Charities and the four sub-entities \nsought \na \ndetermination \nfrom \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development, which \nadministers the unemployment compensation system \ntoday, that they too are exempt. App. 10a\u201311a. \n \nThe Department denied Petitioners\u2019 request to \nwithdraw from the program because it determined \nthat they had not established that they are  \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the  \nmeaning of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 11a.  \nAn administrative law judge reversed that decision,  \nbut the final agency decisionmaker, the Labor  \nand Industry Review Commission, affirmed the \nDepartment\u2019s determination. 11a. On judicial review, \nthe trial court for Douglas County reversed in \nPetitioners\u2019 favor, but the court of appeals and \nWisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Labor and \n\n5 \n \nIndustry Review Commission\u2019s decision. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the court \nof appeals\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin law. It held \nthat the Commission had correctly interpreted Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., including by reasoning that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered \nin a determination of whether an organization is \n\u2018operated primarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u201d App. 21a\u2013\n22a. In other words, the statute required an \u201cobjective \nexamination of [Petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to \ndetermine whether those activities are \u201csecular in \nnature\u201d such that Petitioners are \u201cnot operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u201d App. 32a\u201333a. \n \nApplying that statutory construction to the \norganizations, the court concluded that Petitioners \ndid not qualify for the religious exemption for two \nmain reasons: (1) they did not seek to imbue \nparticipants with the Catholic faith and provided \nparticipants with no religious materials (App. 29a); \nand (2) their activities were primarily charitable  \nand secular (App. 30a), as illustrated by how the  \nactivities of one of the sub-entities, Barron County \nDevelopment Services, Inc., had not changed after it \naffiliated with Catholic Charities (App. 30a\u201331a). The \ncourt noted how this result was consistent with \ncongressional \nhistory \nof \nthe \nparallel \nfederal \nunemployment law, which indicated that \u201can \norphanage or a home for the aged\u201d would not qualify \nas being \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nsimply by virtue of being \u201crelated\u201d to a church. \nApp. 30a. \n\n6 \n \n \nThe court also rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments \nunder the First Amendment, concluding that the \nstatute violated neither the Establishment Clause, \nthe church autonomy principle, nor the Free Exercise \nClause.  \n \nAs to the Establishment Clause, the court held \nthat the statutorily required \u201cneutral and secular \ninquiry\u201d into Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities\u201d (App. \n40a\u201341a) does not improperly \u201ccross into an \nevaluation of religious dogma\u201d (App. 38a\u201339a). \nRather, that objective analysis is consistent with the \ninquiry needed for any religious tax exemption laws, \nwhich have been recognized as valid throughout \nAmerican history. App. 41a\u201344a. And the court held \nthat the statute did not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it neither \u201cregulate[d] internal \nchurch governance nor mandate[d] any activity.\u201d App. \n45a\u201346a. Last, the law did not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise \nrights \nbecause \nimposing \na \ngenerally \napplicable tax is not a constitutionally significant \nburden. App. 48a\u201350a. \n \nPetitioners then filed a petition for writ of \ncertiorari with this Court. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n \nWhile Petitioners would like an exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions, they \nhave not satisfied this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari. \nThe state courts are not split on Petitioners\u2019 First \nAmendment challenges, and Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme \nCourt correctly resolved those challenges, in any \nevent. Likewise, there is no state court split on the \nburden for challenges to the validity of state statutes. \n\n7 \n \nAnd even if there was, this case is a poor vehicle to \nresolve it because the issue was not raised below. \nI. \nCertiorari should be denied on the first \nquestion presented. \n \nThis Court should deny the petition on Petitioners\u2019 \nfirst question: whether the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption \nin \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., \nas \ninterpreted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, violates \nthe First Amendment.  \n \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, there is no split \nof authority among the state supreme courts on the \nFirst Amendment claims they present. The many \nstate court cases they discuss consider only how to \ninterpret and apply similar statutory exemptions, not \nwhether those exemptions comply with the First \nAmendment. And Petitioners identify no federal \ncircuit spilt. Without any disagreement among the \nstate courts or lower federal courts, Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional arguments have not percolated enough \nto merit certiorari.  \n \nIn any event, the Wisconsin Supreme Court got it \nright. Courts routinely deny religious tax exemptions \nto entities that assert religious motivations without \noverly entangling themselves in religious matters. \nThat effort does not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it does not regulate internal church \ngovernance or compel any activity. And the \nunemployment tax does not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise rights: it imposes no constitutionally \nsignificant burden on their religious exercise, and it is \na general law that is neutral and nondiscriminatory \non questions of religious belief.  \n\n8 \n \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on  \nthe First Amendment questions \nPetitioner presents. \n \nPetitioners identify no split on the question of \nwhether states may constitutionally consider an \nemployer\u2019s operations, not just its motivations,  \nin deciding whether it is entitled to a religious \nexemption from a state\u2019s unemployment insurance \ntax system.  \n \n1. No high courts have addressed the First \nAmendment issues Petitioners raise here, let alone in \na way that creates a split. \n \nPetitioners cite seven other state high court cases, \nbut \nthose \ncases \nall \ninvolve \nstate \nstatutory \ninterpretation issues, not First Amendment ones. The \ncases all confront similar interpretation questions \nbecause the states copied the language of a federal \nstatute, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), \nwhich establishes a cooperative federal-state program \nof benefits to unemployed workers. See St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. S. Dakota, 451 U.S. \n772, 775 & n.3 (1981); Comm. Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 287 (Iowa 1982). \nFUTA\u2014like \nstate \nstatutes \ncopying \nit\u2014allows \nqualified state unemployment programs to exclude \nnon-profit employers from coverage as to services \nperformed: \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or \n(B) an organization which is operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and which \nis operated, supervised, controlled, or \n\n9 \n \nprincipally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches . . . . \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b).  \n \nBecause many states have adopted that language, \nmultiple state high court decisions discuss what it \nmeans and how to apply it as a matter of state law. \nThat is the issue presented in the cases cited by \nPetitioners\u2014not \nwhether \nthose \nstate \nstatutes \ncomplied with the First Amendment.  \n \nBegin with the four states that Petitioners \nhighlight as supposedly \u201cfocus[ing] on whether an \norganization has sincere religious beliefs indicating \nthat the purpose of its activities is rooted in religious \nmotivation.\u201d Pet. 16. None of them issued a First \nAmendment holding. \n \nIdaho. \nIn \nDepartment \nof \nEmployment \nv. \nChampion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1372 \n(Idaho 1979), Idaho\u2019s high court found only that an \nagency had \u201cerred in its application of the Idaho \nunemployment security law.\u201d It said nothing about \nthe First Amendment. And, as Petitioners candidly \nadmit, Nampa Christian Schools Foundation v. State \nof Idaho, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) relied on \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d and \u201cdid not reach any \nconstitutional questions.\u201d Pet. 17. \n \nIowa. Petitioners also concede that Community \nLutheran School v. Iowa Department of Job Service, \n326 N.W.2d 286 (Iowa 1982) \u201cdid not need to reach\u201d \nany First Amendment questions. Pet. 17. But \nPetitioners\u2019 suggestion that the court construed the \nstatute to \u201cavoid constitutional issues\u201d is inaccurate. \nPet. 17. The court applied ordinary statutory \ninterpretation principles and then, after doing so, \n\n10 \n \nnoted that it did not need to resolve any First \nAmendment questions because it had granted the \nemployer an exemption as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation. Cmty. Lutheran, 326 N.W.2d at 291\u2013\n92. \n \nMaine. In Schwartz v. Unemployment Insurance \nCommission, 895 A.2d 965, 970\u201371 (Me. 2006), \nMaine\u2019s high court never mentioned the First \nAmendment \nand \ninstead \nexamined \nwhether \n\u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d supported a \nfinding of \u201cprimarily religious\u201d purposes.  \n \nMassachusetts. Massachusetts\u2019 high court found \nthat an organization \u201csatisfie[d] the[ ] statutory \nrequirements\u201d of religious purpose. Kendall v. Dir. of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198\u2013200 (Mass. \n1985). In passing, the court mentioned that the \ndefault of construing tax exemptions against the \ntaxpayer does not apply when the \u201cfree exercise of \nreligion\u201d is at issue, id. at 199, but the court never \nfurther analyzed whether denying the exemption \nwould have violated the First Amendment.  \n \nThen turn to the three states (excluding \nWisconsin) that supposedly embody the \u201copposite side \nof the split.\u201d Pet. 21. Like the first four, none of these \nissued a First Amendment holding. \n \nArkansas. Arkansas\u2019 high court denied a \nreligious purpose exemption to a Catholic-affiliated \nhospital based on the court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the \nstatute in a manner separating motivation from \npurpose of operation.\u201d Terwilliger v. St. Vincent \nInfirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Ark. 1991). \nAs Petitioners note, the case cited Lemon v. \nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) and Meek v. \n\n11 \n \nPittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975) once in passing (Pet Br. \n21), but it engaged in no First Amendment analysis \nwhatsoever. \n \nColorado. Petitioners acknowledge that the \nColorado high court in Samaritan Institute v. Prince-\nWalker, 883 P.2d 3 (Colo. 1994) \u201cdid not address any \nconstitutional issues.\u201d Pet. 22. Instead, it addressed \nwhether the lower court had \u201cproperly interpreted the \nphrase \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019\u201d \nand denied the exemption to a counseling center. \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 4. \n \nMaryland. Again, Petitioners concede that \nMaryland\u2019s high court in Employment Security \nAssociation v. Lutheran High School Association,  \n436 A.2d 481 (Md. 1981) \u201cchose not to address the \nconstitutional issues presented.\u201d Pet. 23. Like the \nothers, the court instead addressed what \u201cfactors may \nappropriately be taken into account\u201d in the religious \npurposes analysis. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, 436 \nA.2d at 487.1 \n \n1 The intermediate state appellate court decisions \nPetitioners cite on both sides of the \u201csplit\u201d likewise did  \nnot involve First Amendment holdings. See By The Hand  \nClub for Kids, NFP, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Emp. Sec., 188 N.E.3d  \n1196, 1198, 1214 (Ill. App. 2020) (evaluating whether  \nreligious afterschool program qualified for Illinois\u2019  \nexemption without \u201creach[ing] the parties\u2019 constitutional \narguments\u201d); Cathedral Arts Project, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Econ. \nOpportunity, 95 So.3d 970, 973 (Fla. App. 2012) \n(examining whether children\u2019s art program qualified for \nFlorida\u2019s exemption); Czigler v. Administrator, 501 N.E.2d \n56, 57 (Ohio App. 1985) (evaluating whether religious \nschool qualified for Ohio\u2019s exemption and mentioning only \n\n12 \n \n \nBecause there is no split on a federal question, \ncertiorari should be denied. This Court does not \nresolve questions of how states interpret their own \nlaws. See Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916 (1997) \n(\u201cNeither this Court nor any other federal tribunal \nhas any authority to place a construction on a state \nstatute different from the one rendered by the highest \ncourt of the State.\u201d). \n \n2. Even on the statutory interpretation question \nof how to construe and apply the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption, the split that Petitioners posit does not \nreally exist. \n \nAmong the cases Petitioners describe as residing \non their side of the ledger (Pet. 16\u201320), it is true that \nthe courts held the entities were operated \u201cprimarily \nfor a religious purpose\u201d and thus entitled to the \nstatutory exemption. But that is because the specific \nfacts in those four cases justified this result, not \nbecause the courts applied a different test from the \nones on Respondents\u2019 side of the ledger. More to the \npoint, none of the cases on Petitioners\u2019 side looked at \nthe entity\u2019s motivation alone\u2014they all also looked to \nsome degree at the entity\u2019s activities, just like \nWisconsin\u2019s supreme court did here. \n \nIdaho. In Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., the \nIdaho court held that services provided by students at \na religious college in a church-run bakery qualified for \nthe exemption because it was part of their religious \ntraining; services provided by regular fulltime \nemployees at the same bakery did not qualify.  \n \nin passing \u201cpotentially serious entanglement by the state \nin violation of the Establishment Clause\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n592 P.2d at 1371\u201372. And in Nampa Christian \nSchools Foundation, the Idaho Supreme Court held \nthat the statutory language required the court to look \nat an organization\u2019s operations, not just its \nmotivations. 719 P.2d at 1180. \n \nIowa. In Community Lutheran School, the court \nlooked at the operations of the school, including the \nincorporation of Lutheran faith into \u201cevery aspect of \nall classes.\u201d 326 N.W. 2d at 291. The curriculum \ninvolved \u201c[s]pecific religious instruction,\u201d \u201creligious \nceremonies [were] held throughout the day,\u201d and \nteachers had to be Lutherans. Id. The school was not \nengaged in otherwise secular activity motivated by a \nreligious purpose. \n \nMaine. \nIn \nSchwartz, \nthe \ncourt \nexamined \noperational facts including how the entity \u201c[brought] \npastors to island communities to lead religious \nservices and provide religious counseling,\u201d paid for \nminister salaries, and had otherwise \u201cmaintained its \nreligious emphasis and function.\u201d 895 A.2d at 970. \n \nMassachusetts. In Kendall, the court rejected a \nrule that would grant exemptions only to schools \n\u201cdevoted to religious instruction.\u201d 473 N.E.2d at 199. \nBut the court noted how the school was \u201coperated in \naccordance \nwith \nchurch \nprinciples,\u201d \nprovided \n\u201c[c]lasses in religious education,\u201d and held \u201cSaturday \nmass . . . for the school\u2019s resident students.\u201d Id. \nPetitioners repeatedly point to Kendall, but it did not \nrely on religious motivations alone.2 \n \n2 The intermediate state appellate cases Petitioners \ncite similarly considered operational facts, not just \nmotivations. By The Hand Club for Kids, NFP, Inc.,  \n\n14 \n \n \nAll told, none of those state cases hold that an \norganization\u2019s motivation alone is sufficient to qualify \nfor the \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nexemption. \n \nThis analytical approach is consistent with the \ncongressional history of FUTA, which many state \ncourts have looked to in construing their statutes. See \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 7; Terwilliger, 304 \nS.W.2d at 698; Sugar Plum Tree Nursery Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 285 N.W.2d 23, 24\u201325 (Iowa 1979). \nThat history provides examples of what the exception \nencompasses:   \nA college devoted primarily to preparing \nstudents for the ministry would be exempt, \nas would a novitiate or a house of study \ntraining candidates to become members of \nreligious orders. On the other hand, a \nchurch related (separately incorporated) \ncharitable organization (such as, for \nexample, an orphanage or home for the \naged) would not be considered under this \nparagraph to be operated primarily for \nreligious purposes. \n \n188 N.E.3d at 1208\u201309 (afterschool program qualified for \nexemption based on executive director\u2019s religious goals; \ngoverning documents; control of key staff appointments \nand assets by the church; requirement that all staff adhere \nto a religious doctrinal statement and regularly attend \nchurch; a \u201cpervasive Bible-based program content that \nincludes evangelical study material\u201d; and frequent prayer); \nCzigler, 501 N.E.2d at 58 (religious school qualified where \nstudents recognized Jewish holidays, studied Hebrew and \nreligion, and were of the Jewish faith). \n\n15 \n \nS.Rep.No.752, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 48-49 (1970); \nH.R.Rep.No.612, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1969)) \n(quoted in St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran, 451 U.S. \nat 781). Those examples\u2014especially the \u201corphanage \nor home for the aged\u201d charitable organizations that \nare merely \u201cchurch related\u201d\u2014demonstrate how state \ncourts are correctly taking the entity\u2019s operations into \naccount. \n \nPetitioners thus offer this Court no developed \ndisagreement among state courts at all, much less one \non a federal constitutional issue. As a result, the issue \nthey present is not appropriate for this Court\u2019s \nconsideration. \nB. \nThe decision below follows directly \nfrom this Court\u2019s precedents. \n \nThe Petition also does not warrant certiorari \nbecause the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly \napplied this Court\u2019s precedents.  \n \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nWisconsin\u2019s \nstatute \nviolates the First Amendment in three ways: (1) by \nrequiring Wisconsin courts to conduct an \u201cintrusive \ninquiry into the operations of religious organizations\u201d; \n(2) by violating the church autonomy principle, \nthrough \u201cpenalizing\u201d its creation of charitable entities \nseparate from the Church; and (3) by abandoning the \nprinciple of neutrality through denying an exemption \nto religious organizations that structure themselves \ndifferently. See Pet. 23\u201331. This Court\u2019s precedents do \nnot support those claims. \n \n1. The Wisconsin statute, interpreted to require \nan examination of \u201cboth the motives and the activities \nof the organization\u201d seeking an exemption, does not \n\n16 \n \nrequire excessive government entanglement with \nreligion. App. 28a. In Walz v. Tax Commission of  \nthe City of New York, this Court recognized the \nunremarkable principle that granting exemptions \nfrom taxation \u201coccasions some degree of involvement \nwith religion.\u201d 397 U.S. 664, 674 (1970). As Justice \nHarlan explained in his concurrence, \u201cevaluating the \nscope of charitable activities in proportion to doctrinal \npursuits may be difficult,\u201d but that difficulty \u201cdoes not \nrender the interference undue so long as it \u201cdoes not \nentail judicial inquiry into dogma and belief.\u201d Id. at \n697 n.1 (Harlan, J., concurring).  \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court did not cross that \nline. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court never \u201csecond-guess[ed]\u201d Catholic \nCharities\u2019 \u201cbelief that what it did was filled with \nreligious purpose.\u201d Pet. 28. Rather, the Court \n\u201caccept[ed] these [beliefs] at face value\u201d and did not \nfind Catholic Charities\u2019 asserted religious motivations \nto be \u201cinsincere, fraudulent, or otherwise not \ncredible.\u201d App. 28a\u201329a. And it engaged in \u201cno \nexamination of whether CCB\u2019s or the sub-entities\u2019 \nactivities are consistent or inconsistent with Catholic \ndoctrine.\u201d App. 40a. Instead, the Court relied on the \norganization\u2019s \u201cprimarily charitable and secular\u201d \nactivities, and especially how the \u201cservices provided \nwould not differ in any sense\u201d whether provided by an \norganization with religious or secular motivations. \nApp. \n30a\u201331a. \nThat \ndoes \nnot \nrepresent \nan \n\u201cinquisition\u201d into religious beliefs (Pet. 28); it is \nexactly what Congress suggested should be done to \ndetermine whether a religious purpose is \u201cprimary.\u201d \nSee H.R. Rep. No. 91-612, at 44 (1969). \n\n17 \n \n \n2. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also followed \nthis Court\u2019s precedents in determining that its \ninterpretation of state law did not violate the church \nautonomy principle. This Court held in Kedroff v. St. \nNicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in \nNorth America, 344 U.S. 94, 119 (1952), that states \nmay not determine questions of religious governance. \nThere, the state court had adjudicated a dispute \nbetween two branches of the Russian Orthodox \nchurch and ordered that New York churches \nrecognize the governing body of one of those branches. \nId. at 99 n.3. This Court held that the state violated \nautonomy principles by \u201cdisplac[ing] one church \nadministrator with another . . . [and] pass[ing] the \ncontrol of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one \nchurch authority to another.\u201d Id. at 119. \n \nThis case is nothing like the decision invalidated \nin Kedroff. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment insurance law \nneither requires nor prohibits any particular religious \ngovernance structure or leadership. Rather, it \n\u201cdefines what employment is for the purposes of \nunemployment insurance without reference to any \nreligious principles or any attempt to control internal \nchurch operations.\u201d App. 45a\u201346a. That \u201cdoes not \nconcern matters that are \u2018strictly\u2019 or even remotely \n\u2018ecclesiastical,\u2019 which belong to the church alone.\u201d \nApp. 45a\u201346a.  \n \n \n3. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also rightly \nfound no violation of the neutrality principle under \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. A free exercise challenge \nrequires the claimant to show that his religious \nexercise was significantly burdened and that the law \nis not \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cgenerally applicable.\u201d Kennedy v. \nBremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 (2022). The \n\n18 \n \nstate court here correctly held that Petitioners failed \nat the first step of showing a constitutionally \nsignificant burden. \n \nA free exercise clause claimant must demonstrate \nthat the challenged law burdens their freedom to \nexercise religion in a significant or substantial way: \n\u201c[i]t is virtually self-evident that the Free Exercise \nClause does not require an exemption from a \ngovernmental program unless, at a minimum, \ninclusion in the program actually burdens the \nclaimant\u2019s freedom to exercise religious rights.\u201d Tony \n& Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, 471 U.S. \n290, 303 (1985).   \n \nThe Wisconsin court held that Petitioners had \nfailed to show that the unemployment insurance \nstatute burdened their religious beliefs. App. 49a. The \nstate law did not prohibit Petitioners from engaging \nin any religious activity and, despite participating for \nmany years in the unemployment insurance program, \nthey did not contend that it significantly or \nsubstantially burdened their religious practices or \nbeliefs. App. 49a. \n \nThat holding is consistent with cases like Jimmy \nSwaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization of \nCalifornia, 493 U.S. 378, 391 (1990), which held that \nthe financial impacts of state taxation schemes on an \nentity\u2019s religious activities are not \u201cconstitutionally \nsignificant.\u201d  \n \nSuch taxation regimes are unlike the laws in the \ncases Petitioners rely on here. Pet. 24. The ordinance \nin Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532 (1993), denied one \ndenomination the ability to pray in a park but allowed \n\n19 \n \nit for others; the criminal conviction for Bible talks in \na public park in Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, \n272\u201373 (1951), similarly burdened that group\u2019s free \nexercise right; and the law in Larson v. Valente, 456 \nU.S. 228, 247 n.23 (1982), forced a denomination to \nregister and be regulated as a charity based on its  \ndonor base. Tax exemptions for groups that engage in \nreligious activities, in contrast, do not force ineligible \ngroups to do anything and do not burden their free \nexercise rights. \n \nHere, Petitioners failed to show how \u201cthe payment \nof unemployment tax prevents them from fulfilling \nany religious function or engaging in any religious \nactivities.\u201d App. 50a. That defeats their argument, \nwhether \nunder \nthe \nFree \nExercise \nor \nthe \nEstablishment Clause. \n \nII. \nCertiorari should be denied on the second \nquestion presented. \n \nPetitioners also ask the Court to resolve a \nsupposed split regarding the burden to overcome the \npresumption \nof \nconstitutionality \nafforded \nto \nlegislative \nenactments \nwhen \nchallenging \nthe \nconstitutionality of a statute. \n \nThis split is illusory, too. This Court and every \nstate\u2019s highest court, save Alaska\u2019s, has articulated \nthis presumption by saying that a challenger must \nshow beyond a reasonable doubt that a statute is \nunconstitutional. \nOther \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption have been used too\u2014by the same courts, \nand even in the same cases\u2014but these represent mere \nrhetorical variation, not substantive differences in \nthe presumption. Petitioners have failed to point to a \n\n20 \n \nsingle case where the choice of one formulation of the \npresumption over another made a difference in the \noutcome.  \n \nAnd even if a substantive, outcome-determinative \nsplit existed, this case presents a poor vehicle to \nresolve it. The courts below dedicated only one \nparagraph of discussion to the issue, in a dissent. This \nlack of development resulted from Petitioners\u2019 failure \nto raise the issue at any point before their petition for \ncertiorari. The issue has therefore not been \nconsidered below in a way that tees it up for this \nCourt\u2019s consideration. \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on the \npresumption-of-constitutionality \nquestion Petitioners present. \n \nPetitioners tell the Court that the decision below \nreinforced a split that exists over the proper standard \nfor the judicial review of statutes. Pet. 31. Petitioners \npoint out that the Wisconsin Supreme Court, along \nwith the high courts of several other states, \nsometimes says that a party challenging a statute on \nconstitutional \ngrounds \nmust \nshow \nits \nunconstitutionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. \nat 33\u201334. Petitioners assert that this is a higher \nstandard than that used by other state high courts \nand \nthe \nfederal \ncourts, \nwhich \nrequire \nthat \nunconstitutionality \nbe \n\u201cclearly\u201d \nor \n\u201cplain[ly]\u201d \ndemonstrated. Id. at 31\u201333.  \n \nThere is no such split. Any difference Petitioners \nidentify is merely a rhetorical one over how to refer to \nthe \npresumption \nof \nconstitutionality \nafforded \nstatutes. This presumption is one courts, both federal \n\n21 \n \nand state, have unanimously adopted when deciding \nconstitutional challenges to statutes. See Christopher \nR. Green, Clarity and Reasonable Doubt in Early \nState-Constitutional Judicial Review, 57 S. Tex. L. \nRev. 169, 172\u201382 (2015). \n \nAll courts (including this one), save Alaska\u2019s, have \nexpressed the presumption of constitutionality by \nsaying that a challenger must show beyond a \nreasonable doubt that a statute is unconstitutional. \nGreen, supra, at 172, 179\u201382 (2015); e.g., Adkins v. \nChildren\u2019s Hosp., 261 U.S. 525, 544 (1923) (\u201cThis \ncourt, by an unbroken line of decisions from Chief \nJustice Marshall to the present day, has steadily \nadhered to the rule that every possible presumption \nis in favor of the validity of an act of Congress until \novercome beyond rational doubt.\u201d). \n \nAnd \nall \ncourts \nhave \nalso \nexpressed \nthe \npresumption \nby \nsaying \nthe \nshowing \nof \nunconstitutionality must be clear, plain, or manifest. \nGreen, supra, at 176\u2013178; e.g., United States v. \nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000) (\u201cDue respect for \nthe decisions of a coordinate branch of Government \ndemands \nthat \nwe \ninvalidate \na \ncongressional \nenactment only upon a plain showing that Congress \nhas exceeded its constitutional bounds.\u201d). Sometimes \nthese formulations of the presumption\u2014call them the \nclarity formulations\u2014appear in the same case as the \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation. See, e.g., \nState v. Kahalewai, 541 P.2d 1020, 1024 (Haw. 1975) \n(holding that the showing of unconstitutionality must \nbe \u201cclear and convincing\u201d and \u201cbeyond all reasonable \ndoubt\u201d). In fact, seven states adopted the two \nformulations in the same case. Green, supra, at 185 \n\n22 \n \n(New York, Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, Rhode \nIsland, Idaho, and Utah). \n \nSome state courts, including Wisconsin\u2019s, prefer a \nparticular formulation of the presumption. E.g., App. \n37a. Other state courts and the federal courts \ncontinue to use both the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nand clarity formulations. Compare Dutra v. Trs. of \nBoston Univ., 96 F.4th 15 (1st Cir. 2024) (\u201cA \nlegislative enactment carries with it a presumption of \nconstitutionality, and the challenging party must \ndemonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that there \nare no \u2018conceivable grounds\u2019 which could support its \nvalidity.\u201d (citations omitted)), with United States v. \nAnderson, 771 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir. 2014) (\u201c\u2018[A] general \nreticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation\u2019s elected \nleaders\u2019 and \u2018proper respect for a coordinate branch of \nthe government\u2019 requires that a federal court strike \ndown an Act of Congress only if \u2018the lack of \nconstitutional authority to pass the act in question is \nclearly demonstrated.\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)). And still \nothers use a mash-up of the two. E.g. State v. \nCrawford, 478 S.W.2d 314, 316 (Mo. 1972) (\u201cA statute \nis presumed to be constitutional and will not be \ndeclared unconstitutional unless it clearly and \nundoubtedly violates some constitutional provision.\u201d) \n \nIn short, the clarity and beyond-a-reasonable-\ndoubt formulations are just different ways of naming \nthe same presumption\u2014they are \u201calternative verbal \nformulations of the same rule.\u201d Green, supra, at 171, \n184, 186 (referring to the two formulations as \n\u201csynonymous\u201d and \u201cprecedentially interchangeable\u201d). \nIndeed, \u201c[t]o be clearly and truly convinced is to lack \nany reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 188 (citation omitted). \n\n23 \n \n \nPetitioners wrongly suggest that the beyond-a-\nreasonable-doubt formulation places a \nheavier \nburden on a party challenging a statute than the \nclarity formulations do. Pet. 35\u201336. Any difference  \nis rhetorical. Hugh Spitzer, Reasoning v. Rhetoric:  \nThe Strange Case of \u201cUnconstitutional Beyond a \nReasonable Doubt\u201d, 74 Rutgers U. L. Rev. 1429,  \n(2022) (noting that the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulation is a \u201crhetorical commitment to judicial \ndeference\u201d (alteration omitted) (citation omitted); \nIsland County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 384, 393 (Wash. \n1998) (Talmadge, J., concurring) (referring to same as \n\u201csimply a hortatory expression, a guide for our \nconsideration, a reminder that the Legislature\u2014not \nthe Court\u2014is the body the people of our state have \nchosen to make their laws\u201d). \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, among other state \nhigh courts, has said as much. In Mayo v. Wisconsin \nInjured Patients and Families Compensation Fund, \nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]n the \ncontext of a challenge to a statute\u2019s constitutionality, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt expresses the force or \nconviction with which a court must conclude, as a \nmatter of law, that a statute is unconstitutional \nbefore the statute . . . can be set aside.\u201d 914 N.W.2d \n678, 689 (Wis. 2018) (citation omitted); Spitzer,  \nsupra, at 1452 (interpreting this line in Mayo as \n\u201cessentially converting the [beyond-a-reasonable-\ndoubt] formulation into a rhetorical flourish meant to \nemphasize that the justices should have a high degree \nof \nconfidence \nof \nunconstitutionality \nprior \nto \ninvalidating a statute\u201d). In other words, \u201cbeyond a \nreasonable doubt\u201d in the judicial-review context is not \nthe high burden of proof it represents in the criminal-\n\n24 \n \nlaw context. See In re Commitment of Alger,  \n858 N.W.2d 346, 353\u201354 (Wis. 2015) (distinguishing \n\u201cunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d from \n\u201cprobably unconstitutional\u201d). \n \nThe substantive similarity between the clarity and \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption accounts for why Petitioners cannot \npoint to a single case in which a choice among them \nhad any effect on the outcome. Accord Island County, \n955 P.2d at 393 (Talmadge, J., concurring) (\u201cI have \nnot heard a judge say, and I have not read a case that \nsays, \u2018I believe this statute is clearly and convincingly \nunconstitutional, but I am not persuaded it is \nunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d).  \n \nContrary \nto \nPetitioners\u2019 \nclaim \nthat \nthe  \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation \u201cthreatens \nconstitutional rights,\u201d (Pet. 35), the judicial and \nscholarly consensus is that the formulation is \u201cnot a \npresumption or doctrine that drives the outcome of \ncases.\u201d Spitzer, supra, at 1433. This case is in line \nwith that consensus: both the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that their \nshared interpretation of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 \npassed constitutional muster, but only the former \nused the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation. \nCompare App. 50a, with App. 162a. \n \nIn sum, there is no split. Rather, different states \nhave \ndeveloped \nvarious \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption of constitutionality. In practice, the \nsuperficial differences in the wording of various \nformulations are just that\u2014disguises for a \u201cvery \nstrong consensus\u201d among courts on how to apply the \n\n25 \n \npresumption of constitutionality. Green, supra, at \n197. \nB. \nEven if a split of authority existed, \nthis case would be a poor vehicle for \nthis Court to resolve it. \n \nThis Court typically will not address issues that \nwere not raised below. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. \n19, 34 (2001) (\u201cWe do not reach this issue because it \nwas not raised or briefed below.\u201d); E.E.O.C. v. Fed. \nLabor Relations Auth., 476 U.S. 19, 24 (dismissing \nwrit of certiorari as improvidently granted because \nissues were not raised below).  \n \nPetitioners concede that they failed to raise below \ntheir challenge to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulation of the presumption of constitutionality. \nPet. 36. As a result, there was but one paragraph of \ndiscussion, in a dissent, about the standard. App. \n93a\u201394a. With so little development in the lower \ncourts, and none by the parties, this case is not the \none in which to resolve a split, if there were one, \nregarding the proper beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulation. \n \n \n\n26 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition for certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOSHUA L.

(collectively, \u201cApplicants\u201d) respectfully request an \nextension by sixty days to and including Monday, August 12, 2024, for the filing of a \npetition for a writ of certiorari in this matter. Unless an extension is granted, Appli-\ncants\u2019 deadline for the filing of the petition will be June 12, 2024.1 This application is \nsubmitted more than ten days prior to the filing deadline. \nIn support of this request, Applicants state as follows: \n1. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its opinion on March 14, 2024. App.1. \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257(a).  \n2. The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. To comply with the Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act (FUTA), all states must operate their unemployment com-\npensation programs consistent with numerous federal requirements. See 26 U.S.C. \n3304(a). But under both federal and conforming Wisconsin law, service \u201c[i]n the em-\nploy of  * * *  an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and \nwhich is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or con-\n \n1  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its opinion on March 14, 2024, App.1, \nmaking the current deadline June 12, 2024. A sixty-day extension would result in a \nSunday deadline (August 11, 2024), meaning the petition would be due the following \nMonday, August 12, 2024. See Sup. Ct. R. 30(1). \n\n \n2 \nvention or association of churches\u201d is exempt from the obligation to pay into Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s unemployment compensation program. See 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1); Wis. Stat. \n108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). This case involves the Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorpo-\nrated charitable arm, Catholic Charities Bureau. It is undisputed that Catholic Char-\nities and its sub-entities are \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church.\u201d App.3 n.3. The only dispute is whether they are \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes.\u201d App.3. \n3. The Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed that Catholic Charities is motivated by \na religious mission to serve those in need: \u201cCCB and the sub-entities profess to have \na religious motivation.  * * *  We accept these statements at face value, and [Wiscon-\nsin] does not argue that these assertions of religious motivation are insincere, fraud-\nulent, or otherwise not credible.\u201d App.27. Instead\u2014relying on an irrelevant state \ncourt ministerial exception precedent\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that \u201cin \ndetermining whether an organization is \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019  \n* * *  we must examine both the motivations and the activities of the organization.\u201d \nApp.23-26 (emphasis added) (citing Coulee Catholic Schools v. LIRC, 768 N.W.2d 868 \n(Wis. Sup. Ct. 2009)). \n4. The court therefore assessed whether Catholic Charities was engaged in what \nthe court thought were activities \u201ctypical\u201d of an organization operated for religious \npurposes: \u201ccorporate worship services,\u201d \u201cevangelical outreach,\u201d imbuing \u201cprogram \nparticipants with the Catholic faith,\u201d and supplying \u201creligious materials to program \nparticipants.\u201d App.25, 26, 28. Ignoring the fact that these activities would only be \nconsidered \u201ctypical\u201d for some religious denominations, the court held that Catholic \n\n \n3 \nCharities\u2019 \u201cactivities are primarily charitable and secular\u201d in nature because serving \nthe poor and needy could be done \u201cby organizations of either religious or secular mo-\ntivations, and the services provided would not differ in any sense.\u201d App.28-29; see \nalso id. at 31 (\u201cAn objective examination of the actual activities of [Applicants] reveals \nthat their activities are secular in nature.\u201d). The Court thus concluded that Catholic \nCharities was not \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d because it serves people \nof all faiths and does not proselytize\u2014two tenants of Catholic Charities\u2019 faith. App.28-\n31. \n5. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also rejected Catholic Charities\u2019 First Amend-\nment arguments. First, it \u201cpresume[d] that the statute is constitutional\u201d and required \nCatholic Charities to \u201cprove that the challenged statute has been applied in an un-\nconstitutional manner beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d App.35. Then, under this defer-\nential standard, the court explained that its interpretation of the unemployment com-\npensation statute was constitutional because courts could \u201cexamin[e] the activities \nand motivations of a religious organization\u201d through \u201ca neutral and secular inquiry \nbased on objective criteria\u201d to determine whether an organization was operated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes. App.39.  \n6. This case therefore raises at least two exceptionally important First Amend-\nment questions. First, it raises the question whether civil courts violate the First \nAmendment when they decide that a religious organization is not \u201coperated primarily \nfor religious purposes\u201d because it does not engage in proselytization or other \u201ctypical\u201d \n\n \n4 \nreligious activities but does support the poor, hungry, and disabled for religious rea-\nsons. As the courts below acknowledged, courts are divided on this question. See App. \n21 n.11; Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. v. Labor & Indus. Rev. Comm\u2019n, 987 N.W.2d \n778 (Wis. Ct. App. 2023). \n7. Second, the decision below separately raises the question whether state courts \nare permitted to apply an \u201cunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of \nreview when deciding questions of federal constitutional law. This is also the subject \nof a split of authority. See, e.g., Hugh Spitzer, Reasoning v. Rhetoric: The Strange \nCase of \u201cUnconstitutional Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d, 74 Rutgers U.L. Rev. 1429, \n1439-1456 (2022) (describing use of the standard in state court decisions and a split \nof authority).  \n8. Applicants\u2019 counsel need additional time to prepare their petition in this case. \nApplicants\u2019 counsel have had substantial briefing and argument obligations from \nMarch through May of this year, including: \n\u2022 Civil Rights Department v.

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy.

Rev. 1429, (2022) ................ 23, 24 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis case involves an effort by Catholic Charities \nof the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin, and four \nindependently incorporated sub-entities of Catholic \nCharities to obtain a state statutory exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions on the \ngrounds that they are \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes.\u201d They argue the First Amendment \ncompels this result. \n \nNo split of authority among the states\u2019 supreme \ncourts exists on that constitutional question, and the \nWisconsin Supreme Court decision does not directly \nconflict with the decision of any federal circuit or state \nhigh court. All courts look to some degree at the \noperations of the group seeking an exemption; none \nsimply grant the exemption solely based on the \ngroup\u2019s assertion that its activities are religiously \nmotivated. On the merits, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt correctly declined to hold that the First \nAmendment \nentitles \nPetitioners \nto \nthis \ntax \nexemption.  \n \nLikewise, no split of authority exists regarding the \npresumption of constitutionality afforded to statutes \nwhen their validity is challenged. The variations \nPetitioners identify are rhetorical, not substantive. \nAnd even if a split existed, Petitioners did not raise \nthis issue at any level below and therefore it was not \nsufficiently developed to warrant this Court\u2019s review.  \n \nThe petition for certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nWisconsin \nestablished \nits \nunemployment \ncompensation system in 1932, the first in the Nation. \nApp. 14a. It enacted its law, codified today in Wis. \nStat. ch. 108, to \u201cavoid the risk or hazards that will \nbefall those, who, because of employment, are \ndependent upon others for their livelihood.\u201d App. 14a. \nThe law collects \u201climited funds from a large number \nof employers, particularly during periods of stable \nemployment, then pay[s] out benefits during periods \nof high unemployment from the funds that have been \naccumulated.\u201d App. 14a. \n \nGenerally, any service performed for pay for a \npublic, private, or nonprofit employer is covered by \nChapter 108. App. 15a. But some services are \nstatutorily exempt. Relevant here, Wisconsin law \nexempts paid service \u201cin the employ of an \norganization \noperated \nprimarily \nfor \nreligious \npurposes and operated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nPetitioners seek that exemption here. \n \nCatholic Charities states that it provides services \nto the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the \nsocial ministry of the Catholic church in the Diocese \nof Superior and that its \u201cpurpose . . . is to be an \neffective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d App. 7a. It also \nstates that its religious mission requires it to offer \nservices to all in need, not just those of the Catholic \nfaith. App. 7a. \n \nCatholic Charities offers various charitable \nservices partly through four separately incorporated \nsub-entities, the other Petitioners in this case: \n\n3 \n \n\u2022 Barron County Developmental Services, Inc., \nprovides job placement, job coaching, and an \n\u201carray of services to assist individuals with \ndisabilities \n[to] \nget \nemployment \nin \nthe \ncommunity.\u201d This company had no religious \naffiliation until it joined Catholic Charities in \n2014. App. 8a. \n\u2022 Black River Industries, Inc. provides job \ntraining and daily living services to people with \ndevelopmental or mental health disabilities, as \nwell as those with a limited income. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. \n\u2022 Diversified \nServices, \nInc. \nprovides  \nwork \nopportunities \nto \nindividuals \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. App. 9a.  \n\u2022 Headwaters, Inc., provides services for people \nwith disabilities including training related to \nactivities of daily living and employment, and \nprovides Head Start home visitation services. \nApp. 9a. \n \nPeople receiving services from these organizations \nreceive no religious training or orientation, and none \nof them attempts to \u201cinculcate the Catholic faith.\u201d \nApp. 10a. Employees need not ascribe to any religious \nfaith. App. 10a. \n \nNone of the sub-entities receives funding from the \nDiocese of Superior. Barron County Development \nServices, \nInc. \ncontracts \nwith \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development\u2019s Division of \nVocational Rehabilitation to provide its services. App. \n8a. Black River Industries, Inc.\u2019s funding comes \nlargely from county and state government. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. Diversified Services, Inc. receives its funding from \n\n4 \n \nFamily Care, a Medicaid long-term care program,  \nand private contracts. App. 9a. And Headwaters, Inc.  \nis funded primarily through government contracts.  \nApp. 9a. \n \nCatholic Charities has participated in Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment insurance program since 1972, when \nit submitted a form describing the nature of its \noperations \nas \n\u201ccharitable,\u201d \n\u201ceducational,\u201d \nand \n\u201crehabilitative,\u201d not \u201creligious.\u201d App. 10a. The state \nagency then administering the uninsurance program \ndetermined that Catholic Charities was subject to the \nunemployment insurance law. App. 10a.  \n \nIn 2015, a Wisconsin trial court determined that a \nsub-entity of Catholic Charities that is not part of this \ncase was eligible for the religious purposes exception \nin Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 10a. After that \nruling, Catholic Charities and the four sub-entities \nsought \na \ndetermination \nfrom \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development, which \nadministers the unemployment compensation system \ntoday, that they too are exempt. App. 10a\u201311a. \n \nThe Department denied Petitioners\u2019 request to \nwithdraw from the program because it determined \nthat they had not established that they are  \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the  \nmeaning of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 11a.  \nAn administrative law judge reversed that decision,  \nbut the final agency decisionmaker, the Labor  \nand Industry Review Commission, affirmed the \nDepartment\u2019s determination. 11a. On judicial review, \nthe trial court for Douglas County reversed in \nPetitioners\u2019 favor, but the court of appeals and \nWisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Labor and \n\n5 \n \nIndustry Review Commission\u2019s decision. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the court \nof appeals\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin law. It held \nthat the Commission had correctly interpreted Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., including by reasoning that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered \nin a determination of whether an organization is \n\u2018operated primarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u201d App. 21a\u2013\n22a. In other words, the statute required an \u201cobjective \nexamination of [Petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to \ndetermine whether those activities are \u201csecular in \nnature\u201d such that Petitioners are \u201cnot operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u201d App. 32a\u201333a. \n \nApplying that statutory construction to the \norganizations, the court concluded that Petitioners \ndid not qualify for the religious exemption for two \nmain reasons: (1) they did not seek to imbue \nparticipants with the Catholic faith and provided \nparticipants with no religious materials (App. 29a); \nand (2) their activities were primarily charitable  \nand secular (App. 30a), as illustrated by how the  \nactivities of one of the sub-entities, Barron County \nDevelopment Services, Inc., had not changed after it \naffiliated with Catholic Charities (App. 30a\u201331a). The \ncourt noted how this result was consistent with \ncongressional \nhistory \nof \nthe \nparallel \nfederal \nunemployment law, which indicated that \u201can \norphanage or a home for the aged\u201d would not qualify \nas being \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nsimply by virtue of being \u201crelated\u201d to a church. \nApp. 30a. \n\n6 \n \n \nThe court also rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments \nunder the First Amendment, concluding that the \nstatute violated neither the Establishment Clause, \nthe church autonomy principle, nor the Free Exercise \nClause.  \n \nAs to the Establishment Clause, the court held \nthat the statutorily required \u201cneutral and secular \ninquiry\u201d into Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities\u201d (App. \n40a\u201341a) does not improperly \u201ccross into an \nevaluation of religious dogma\u201d (App. 38a\u201339a). \nRather, that objective analysis is consistent with the \ninquiry needed for any religious tax exemption laws, \nwhich have been recognized as valid throughout \nAmerican history. App. 41a\u201344a. And the court held \nthat the statute did not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it neither \u201cregulate[d] internal \nchurch governance nor mandate[d] any activity.\u201d App. \n45a\u201346a. Last, the law did not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise \nrights \nbecause \nimposing \na \ngenerally \napplicable tax is not a constitutionally significant \nburden. App. 48a\u201350a. \n \nPetitioners then filed a petition for writ of \ncertiorari with this Court. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n \nWhile Petitioners would like an exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions, they \nhave not satisfied this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari. \nThe state courts are not split on Petitioners\u2019 First \nAmendment challenges, and Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme \nCourt correctly resolved those challenges, in any \nevent. Likewise, there is no state court split on the \nburden for challenges to the validity of state statutes. \n\n7 \n \nAnd even if there was, this case is a poor vehicle to \nresolve it because the issue was not raised below. \nI. \nCertiorari should be denied on the first \nquestion presented. \n \nThis Court should deny the petition on Petitioners\u2019 \nfirst question: whether the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption \nin \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., \nas \ninterpreted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, violates \nthe First Amendment.  \n \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, there is no split \nof authority among the state supreme courts on the \nFirst Amendment claims they present. The many \nstate court cases they discuss consider only how to \ninterpret and apply similar statutory exemptions, not \nwhether those exemptions comply with the First \nAmendment. And Petitioners identify no federal \ncircuit spilt. Without any disagreement among the \nstate courts or lower federal courts, Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional arguments have not percolated enough \nto merit certiorari.  \n \nIn any event, the Wisconsin Supreme Court got it \nright. Courts routinely deny religious tax exemptions \nto entities that assert religious motivations without \noverly entangling themselves in religious matters. \nThat effort does not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it does not regulate internal church \ngovernance or compel any activity. And the \nunemployment tax does not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise rights: it imposes no constitutionally \nsignificant burden on their religious exercise, and it is \na general law that is neutral and nondiscriminatory \non questions of religious belief.  \n\n8 \n \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on  \nthe First Amendment questions \nPetitioner presents. \n \nPetitioners identify no split on the question of \nwhether states may constitutionally consider an \nemployer\u2019s operations, not just its motivations,  \nin deciding whether it is entitled to a religious \nexemption from a state\u2019s unemployment insurance \ntax system.  \n \n1. No high courts have addressed the First \nAmendment issues Petitioners raise here, let alone in \na way that creates a split. \n \nPetitioners cite seven other state high court cases, \nbut \nthose \ncases \nall \ninvolve \nstate \nstatutory \ninterpretation issues, not First Amendment ones. The \ncases all confront similar interpretation questions \nbecause the states copied the language of a federal \nstatute, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), \nwhich establishes a cooperative federal-state program \nof benefits to unemployed workers. See St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. S. Dakota, 451 U.S. \n772, 775 & n.3 (1981); Comm. Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 287 (Iowa 1982). \nFUTA\u2014like \nstate \nstatutes \ncopying \nit\u2014allows \nqualified state unemployment programs to exclude \nnon-profit employers from coverage as to services \nperformed: \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or \n(B) an organization which is operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and which \nis operated, supervised, controlled, or \n\n9 \n \nprincipally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches . . . . \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b).  \n \nBecause many states have adopted that language, \nmultiple state high court decisions discuss what it \nmeans and how to apply it as a matter of state law. \nThat is the issue presented in the cases cited by \nPetitioners\u2014not \nwhether \nthose \nstate \nstatutes \ncomplied with the First Amendment.  \n \nBegin with the four states that Petitioners \nhighlight as supposedly \u201cfocus[ing] on whether an \norganization has sincere religious beliefs indicating \nthat the purpose of its activities is rooted in religious \nmotivation.\u201d Pet. 16. None of them issued a First \nAmendment holding. \n \nIdaho. \nIn \nDepartment \nof \nEmployment \nv. \nChampion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1372 \n(Idaho 1979), Idaho\u2019s high court found only that an \nagency had \u201cerred in its application of the Idaho \nunemployment security law.\u201d It said nothing about \nthe First Amendment. And, as Petitioners candidly \nadmit, Nampa Christian Schools Foundation v. State \nof Idaho, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) relied on \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d and \u201cdid not reach any \nconstitutional questions.\u201d Pet. 17. \n \nIowa. Petitioners also concede that Community \nLutheran School v. Iowa Department of Job Service, \n326 N.W.2d 286 (Iowa 1982) \u201cdid not need to reach\u201d \nany First Amendment questions. Pet. 17. But \nPetitioners\u2019 suggestion that the court construed the \nstatute to \u201cavoid constitutional issues\u201d is inaccurate. \nPet. 17. The court applied ordinary statutory \ninterpretation principles and then, after doing so, \n\n10 \n \nnoted that it did not need to resolve any First \nAmendment questions because it had granted the \nemployer an exemption as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation. Cmty. Lutheran, 326 N.W.2d at 291\u2013\n92. \n \nMaine. In Schwartz v. Unemployment Insurance \nCommission, 895 A.2d 965, 970\u201371 (Me. 2006), \nMaine\u2019s high court never mentioned the First \nAmendment \nand \ninstead \nexamined \nwhether \n\u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d supported a \nfinding of \u201cprimarily religious\u201d purposes.  \n \nMassachusetts. Massachusetts\u2019 high court found \nthat an organization \u201csatisfie[d] the[ ] statutory \nrequirements\u201d of religious purpose. Kendall v. Dir. of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198\u2013200 (Mass. \n1985). In passing, the court mentioned that the \ndefault of construing tax exemptions against the \ntaxpayer does not apply when the \u201cfree exercise of \nreligion\u201d is at issue, id. at 199, but the court never \nfurther analyzed whether denying the exemption \nwould have violated the First Amendment.  \n \nThen turn to the three states (excluding \nWisconsin) that supposedly embody the \u201copposite side \nof the split.\u201d Pet. 21. Like the first four, none of these \nissued a First Amendment holding. \n \nArkansas. Arkansas\u2019 high court denied a \nreligious purpose exemption to a Catholic-affiliated \nhospital based on the court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the \nstatute in a manner separating motivation from \npurpose of operation.\u201d Terwilliger v. St. Vincent \nInfirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Ark. 1991). \nAs Petitioners note, the case cited Lemon v. \nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) and Meek v. \n\n11 \n \nPittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975) once in passing (Pet Br. \n21), but it engaged in no First Amendment analysis \nwhatsoever. \n \nColorado. Petitioners acknowledge that the \nColorado high court in Samaritan Institute v. Prince-\nWalker, 883 P.2d 3 (Colo. 1994) \u201cdid not address any \nconstitutional issues.\u201d Pet. 22. Instead, it addressed \nwhether the lower court had \u201cproperly interpreted the \nphrase \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019\u201d \nand denied the exemption to a counseling center. \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 4. \n \nMaryland. Again, Petitioners concede that \nMaryland\u2019s high court in Employment Security \nAssociation v. Lutheran High School Association,  \n436 A.2d 481 (Md. 1981) \u201cchose not to address the \nconstitutional issues presented.\u201d Pet. 23. Like the \nothers, the court instead addressed what \u201cfactors may \nappropriately be taken into account\u201d in the religious \npurposes analysis. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, 436 \nA.2d at 487.1 \n \n1 The intermediate state appellate court decisions \nPetitioners cite on both sides of the \u201csplit\u201d likewise did  \nnot involve First Amendment holdings. See By The Hand  \nClub for Kids, NFP, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Emp. Sec., 188 N.E.3d  \n1196, 1198, 1214 (Ill. App. 2020) (evaluating whether  \nreligious afterschool program qualified for Illinois\u2019  \nexemption without \u201creach[ing] the parties\u2019 constitutional \narguments\u201d); Cathedral Arts Project, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Econ. \nOpportunity, 95 So.3d 970, 973 (Fla. App. 2012) \n(examining whether children\u2019s art program qualified for \nFlorida\u2019s exemption); Czigler v. Administrator, 501 N.E.2d \n56, 57 (Ohio App. 1985) (evaluating whether religious \nschool qualified for Ohio\u2019s exemption and mentioning only \n\n12 \n \n \nBecause there is no split on a federal question, \ncertiorari should be denied. This Court does not \nresolve questions of how states interpret their own \nlaws. See Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916 (1997) \n(\u201cNeither this Court nor any other federal tribunal \nhas any authority to place a construction on a state \nstatute different from the one rendered by the highest \ncourt of the State.\u201d). \n \n2. Even on the statutory interpretation question \nof how to construe and apply the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption, the split that Petitioners posit does not \nreally exist. \n \nAmong the cases Petitioners describe as residing \non their side of the ledger (Pet. 16\u201320), it is true that \nthe courts held the entities were operated \u201cprimarily \nfor a religious purpose\u201d and thus entitled to the \nstatutory exemption. But that is because the specific \nfacts in those four cases justified this result, not \nbecause the courts applied a different test from the \nones on Respondents\u2019 side of the ledger. More to the \npoint, none of the cases on Petitioners\u2019 side looked at \nthe entity\u2019s motivation alone\u2014they all also looked to \nsome degree at the entity\u2019s activities, just like \nWisconsin\u2019s supreme court did here. \n \nIdaho. In Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., the \nIdaho court held that services provided by students at \na religious college in a church-run bakery qualified for \nthe exemption because it was part of their religious \ntraining; services provided by regular fulltime \nemployees at the same bakery did not qualify.  \n \nin passing \u201cpotentially serious entanglement by the state \nin violation of the Establishment Clause\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n592 P.2d at 1371\u201372. And in Nampa Christian \nSchools Foundation, the Idaho Supreme Court held \nthat the statutory language required the court to look \nat an organization\u2019s operations, not just its \nmotivations. 719 P.2d at 1180. \n \nIowa. In Community Lutheran School, the court \nlooked at the operations of the school, including the \nincorporation of Lutheran faith into \u201cevery aspect of \nall classes.\u201d 326 N.W. 2d at 291. The curriculum \ninvolved \u201c[s]pecific religious instruction,\u201d \u201creligious \nceremonies [were] held throughout the day,\u201d and \nteachers had to be Lutherans. Id. The school was not \nengaged in otherwise secular activity motivated by a \nreligious purpose. \n \nMaine. \nIn \nSchwartz, \nthe \ncourt \nexamined \noperational facts including how the entity \u201c[brought] \npastors to island communities to lead religious \nservices and provide religious counseling,\u201d paid for \nminister salaries, and had otherwise \u201cmaintained its \nreligious emphasis and function.\u201d 895 A.2d at 970. \n \nMassachusetts. In Kendall, the court rejected a \nrule that would grant exemptions only to schools \n\u201cdevoted to religious instruction.\u201d 473 N.E.2d at 199. \nBut the court noted how the school was \u201cope\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

None of these entities issue stock. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n/s/ Eric C. Rassbach \n \n\n \n1 \nAPPLICATION \nTo the Honorable Amy Coney Barrett, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States and Circuit Justice for the Seventh Circuit: \nPursuant to Supreme Court Rule 13(5), Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc., Barron \nCounty Developmental Services, Inc., Diversified Services, Inc., Black River Indus-\ntries, Inc., and Headwaters, Inc. (collectively, \u201cApplicants\u201d) respectfully request an \nextension by sixty days to and including Monday, August 12, 2024, for the filing of a \npetition for a writ of certiorari in this matter. Unless an extension is granted, Appli-\ncants\u2019 deadline for the filing of the petition will be June 12, 2024.1 This application is \nsubmitted more than ten days prior to the filing deadline. \nIn support of this request, Applicants state as follows: \n1. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its opinion on March 14, 2024. App.1. \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257(a).  \n2. The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. To comply with the Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act (FUTA), all states must operate their unemployment com-\npensation programs consistent with numerous federal requirements. See 26 U.S.C. \n3304(a). But under both federal and conforming Wisconsin law, service \u201c[i]n the em-\nploy of  * * *  an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and \nwhich is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or con-\n \n1  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its opinion on March 14, 2024, App.1, \nmaking the current deadline June 12, 2024. A sixty-day extension would result in a \nSunday deadline (August 11, 2024), meaning the petition would be due the following \nMonday, August 12, 2024. See Sup. Ct. R. 30(1). \n\n \n2 \nvention or association of churches\u201d is exempt from the obligation to pay into Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s unemployment compensation program. See 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1); Wis. Stat. \n108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). This case involves the Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorpo-\nrated charitable arm, Catholic Charities Bureau. It is undisputed that Catholic Char-\nities and its sub-entities are \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church.\u201d App.3 n.3. The only dispute is whether they are \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes.\u201d App.3. \n3. The Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed that Catholic Charities is motivated by \na religious mission to serve those in need: \u201cCCB and the sub-entities profess to have \na religious motivation.  * * *  We accept these statements at face value, and [Wiscon-\nsin] does not argue that these assertions of religious motivation are insincere, fraud-\nulent, or otherwise not credible.\u201d App.27. Instead\u2014relying on an irrelevant state \ncourt ministerial exception precedent\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that \u201cin \ndetermining whether an organization is \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019  \n* * *  we must examine both the motivations and the activities of the organization.\u201d \nApp.23-26 (emphasis added) (citing Coulee Catholic Schools v. LIRC, 768 N.W.2d 868 \n(Wis. Sup. Ct. 2009)). \n4. The court therefore assessed whether Catholic Charities was engaged in what \nthe court thought were activities \u201ctypical\u201d of an organization operated for religious \npurposes: \u201ccorporate worship services,\u201d \u201cevangelical outreach,\u201d imbuing \u201cprogram \nparticipants with the Catholic faith,\u201d and supplying \u201creligious materials to program \nparticipants.\u201d App.25, 26, 28. Ignoring the fact that these activities would only be \nconsidered \u201ctypical\u201d for some religious denominations, the court held that Catholic \n\n \n3 \nCharities\u2019 \u201cactivities are primarily charitable and secular\u201d in nature because serving \nthe poor and needy could be done \u201cby organizations of either religious or secular mo-\ntivations, and the services provided would not differ in any sense.\u201d App.28-29; see \nalso id. at 31 (\u201cAn objective examination of the actual activities of [Applicants] reveals \nthat their activities are secular in nature.\u201d). The Court thus concluded that Catholic \nCharities was not \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d because it serves people \nof all faiths and does not proselytize\u2014two tenants of Catholic Charities\u2019 faith. App.28-\n31. \n5. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also rejected Catholic Charities\u2019 First Amend-\nment arguments. First, it \u201cpresume[d] that the statute is constitutional\u201d and required \nCatholic Charities to \u201cprove that the challenged statute has been applied in an un-\nconstitutional manner beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d App.35. Then, under this defer-\nential standard, the court explained that its interpretation of the unemployment com-\npensation statute was constitutional because courts could \u201cexamin[e] the activities \nand motivations of a religious organization\u201d through \u201ca neutral and secular inquiry \nbased on objective criteria\u201d to determine whether an organization was operated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes. App.39.  \n6. This case therefore raises at least two exceptionally important First Amend-\nment questions. First, it raises the question whether civil courts violate the First \nAmendment when they decide that a religious organization is not \u201coperated primarily \nfor religious purposes\u201d because it does not engage in proselytization or other \u201ctypical\u201d \n\n \n4 \nreligious activities but does support the poor, hungry, and disabled for religious rea-\nsons. As the courts below acknowledged, courts are divided on this question. See App. \n21 n.11; Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. v. Labor & Indus. Rev. Comm\u2019n, 987 N.W.2d \n778 (Wis. Ct. App. 2023). \n7. Second, the decision below separately raises the question whether state courts \nare permitted to apply an \u201cunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of \nreview when deciding questions of federal constitutional law. This is also the subject \nof a split of authority. See, e.g., Hugh Spitzer, Reasoning v. Rhetoric: The Strange \nCase of \u201cUnconstitutional Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d, 74 Rutgers U.L. Rev. 1429, \n1439-1456 (2022) (describing use of the standard in state court decisions and a split \nof authority).  \n8. Applicants\u2019 counsel need additional time to prepare their petition in this case. \nApplicants\u2019 counsel have had substantial briefing and argument obligations from \nMarch through May of this year, including: \n\u2022 Civil Rights Department v. Cathy\u2019s Creations, No. F085800 (5th App. Ct. \nCal.) (brief filed May 24, 2024) \n\u2022 Mendham Methodist Church v. Morris County, N.J., No. 2:23-cv-02347 \n(D.N.J.)

City of Atlantic City, No. 23-3265 (3rd Cir.) (brief filed April 10, \n2024) \n9. Applicants\u2019 counsel also have several upcoming case-related obligations, in-\ncluding: \n\u2022 Garrick v. Moody Bible Institute, No. 21-2683 (7th Cir.) (petition for writ of \ncertiorari due July 29, 2024) \n\u2022 St. Joseph Parish v. Nessel, No. 23-1860 (6th Cir.) (oral argument June 11, \n2024) \n\u2022 Bella Health & Wellness v. Weiser, No. 23-939 (D. Colo.) (depositions on \nJune 11 & 12, 2024) \n\u2022 Landor v. Louisiana Dep\u2019t of Corr. & Pub. Safety, No. 23-1197 (U.S.) (brief \ndue June 6, 2024) \n\u2022 Young Israel of Tampa v. HART, No. 22-11787 (11th Cir.) (petition for cer-\ntiorari due June 3, 2024) \n\n \n6 \n\u2022 Bella Health & Wellness v. Weiser, No. 23-939 (D. Colo.) (expert report due \nMay 31, 2024) \n10. Applicants\u2019 counsel also have academic obligations during the relevant \ntimeframe, including managing an international academic conference put on by the \nCentre for Law and Religious Freedom at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland \nfrom June 2-6 and participating in an academic conference put on by the Religious \nLiberty Initiative at the University of Notre Dame from July 9-12.  \n11. For these reasons, Applicants respectfully request a sixty-day extension of time \nfor counsel to prepare a petition that fully addresses the important issues raised by \nthe decision below and frames those issues in a manner that will be most helpful to \nthe Court. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKYLE H.

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy. Pet.7-8 (discussing St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C. RASSBACH \n   Counsel of Record \nNICHOLAS R.

Rev. 1429, (2022) ................ 23, 24 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis case involves an effort by Catholic Charities \nof the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin, and four \nindependently incorporated sub-entities of Catholic \nCharities to obtain a state statutory exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions on the \ngrounds that they are \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes.\u201d They argue the First Amendment \ncompels this result. \n \nNo split of authority among the states\u2019 supreme \ncourts exists on that constitutional question, and the \nWisconsin Supreme Court decision does not directly \nconflict with the decision of any federal circuit or state \nhigh court. All courts look to some degree at the \noperations of the group seeking an exemption; none \nsimply grant the exemption solely based on the \ngroup\u2019s assertion that its activities are religiously \nmotivated. On the merits, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt correctly declined to hold that the First \nAmendment \nentitles \nPetitioners \nto \nthis \ntax \nexemption.  \n \nLikewise, no split of authority exists regarding the \npresumption of constitutionality afforded to statutes \nwhen their validity is challenged. The variations \nPetitioners identify are rhetorical, not substantive. \nAnd even if a split existed, Petitioners did not raise \nthis issue at any level below and therefore it was not \nsufficiently developed to warrant this Court\u2019s review.  \n \nThe petition for certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nWisconsin \nestablished \nits \nunemployment \ncompensation system in 1932, the first in the Nation. \nApp. 14a. It enacted its law, codified today in Wis. \nStat. ch. 108, to \u201cavoid the risk or hazards that will \nbefall those, who, because of employment, are \ndependent upon others for their livelihood.\u201d App. 14a. \nThe law collects \u201climited funds from a large number \nof employers, particularly during periods of stable \nemployment, then pay[s] out benefits during periods \nof high unemployment from the funds that have been \naccumulated.\u201d App. 14a. \n \nGenerally, any service performed for pay for a \npublic, private, or nonprofit employer is covered by \nChapter 108. App. 15a. But some services are \nstatutorily exempt. Relevant here, Wisconsin law \nexempts paid service \u201cin the employ of an \norganization \noperated \nprimarily \nfor \nreligious \npurposes and operated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nPetitioners seek that exemption here. \n \nCatholic Charities states that it provides services \nto the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the \nsocial ministry of the Catholic church in the Diocese \nof Superior and that its \u201cpurpose . . . is to be an \neffective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d App. 7a. It also \nstates that its religious mission requires it to offer \nservices to all in need, not just those of the Catholic \nfaith. App. 7a. \n \nCatholic Charities offers various charitable \nservices partly through four separately incorporated \nsub-entities, the other Petitioners in this case: \n\n3 \n \n\u2022 Barron County Developmental Services, Inc., \nprovides job placement, job coaching, and an \n\u201carray of services to assist individuals with \ndisabilities \n[to] \nget \nemployment \nin \nthe \ncommunity.\u201d This company had no religious \naffiliation until it joined Catholic Charities in \n2014. App. 8a. \n\u2022 Black River Industries, Inc. provides job \ntraining and daily living services to people with \ndevelopmental or mental health disabilities, as \nwell as those with a limited income. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. \n\u2022 Diversified \nServices, \nInc. \nprovides  \nwork \nopportunities \nto \nindividuals \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. App. 9a.  \n\u2022 Headwaters, Inc., provides services for people \nwith disabilities including training related to \nactivities of daily living and employment, and \nprovides Head Start home visitation services. \nApp. 9a. \n \nPeople receiving services from these organizations \nreceive no religious training or orientation, and none \nof them attempts to \u201cinculcate the Catholic faith.\u201d \nApp. 10a. Employees need not ascribe to any religious \nfaith. App. 10a. \n \nNone of the sub-entities receives funding from the \nDiocese of Superior. Barron County Development \nServices, \nInc. \ncontracts \nwith \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development\u2019s Division of \nVocational Rehabilitation to provide its services. App. \n8a. Black River Industries, Inc.\u2019s funding comes \nlargely from county and state government. App. 8a\u2013\n9a. Diversified Services, Inc. receives its funding from \n\n4 \n \nFamily Care, a Medicaid long-term care program,  \nand private contracts. App. 9a. And Headwaters, Inc.  \nis funded primarily through government contracts.  \nApp. 9a. \n \nCatholic Charities has participated in Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment insurance program since 1972, when \nit submitted a form describing the nature of its \noperations \nas \n\u201ccharitable,\u201d \n\u201ceducational,\u201d \nand \n\u201crehabilitative,\u201d not \u201creligious.\u201d App. 10a. The state \nagency then administering the uninsurance program \ndetermined that Catholic Charities was subject to the \nunemployment insurance law. App. 10a.  \n \nIn 2015, a Wisconsin trial court determined that a \nsub-entity of Catholic Charities that is not part of this \ncase was eligible for the religious purposes exception \nin Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 10a. After that \nruling, Catholic Charities and the four sub-entities \nsought \na \ndetermination \nfrom \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development, which \nadministers the unemployment compensation system \ntoday, that they too are exempt. App. 10a\u201311a. \n \nThe Department denied Petitioners\u2019 request to \nwithdraw from the program because it determined \nthat they had not established that they are  \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the  \nmeaning of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. App. 11a.  \nAn administrative law judge reversed that decision,  \nbut the final agency decisionmaker, the Labor  \nand Industry Review Commission, affirmed the \nDepartment\u2019s determination. 11a. On judicial review, \nthe trial court for Douglas County reversed in \nPetitioners\u2019 favor, but the court of appeals and \nWisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Labor and \n\n5 \n \nIndustry Review Commission\u2019s decision. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the court \nof appeals\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin law. It held \nthat the Commission had correctly interpreted Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., including by reasoning that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered \nin a determination of whether an organization is \n\u2018operated primarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u201d App. 21a\u2013\n22a. In other words, the statute required an \u201cobjective \nexamination of [Petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to \ndetermine whether those activities are \u201csecular in \nnature\u201d such that Petitioners are \u201cnot operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u201d App. 32a\u201333a. \n \nApplying that statutory construction to the \norganizations, the court concluded that Petitioners \ndid not qualify for the religious exemption for two \nmain reasons: (1) they did not seek to imbue \nparticipants with the Catholic faith and provided \nparticipants with no religious materials (App. 29a); \nand (2) their activities were primarily charitable  \nand secular (App. 30a), as illustrated by how the  \nactivities of one of the sub-entities, Barron County \nDevelopment Services, Inc., had not changed after it \naffiliated with Catholic Charities (App. 30a\u201331a). The \ncourt noted how this result was consistent with \ncongressional \nhistory \nof \nthe \nparallel \nfederal \nunemployment law, which indicated that \u201can \norphanage or a home for the aged\u201d would not qualify \nas being \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nsimply by virtue of being \u201crelated\u201d to a church. \nApp. 30a. \n\n6 \n \n \nThe court also rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments \nunder the First Amendment, concluding that the \nstatute violated neither the Establishment Clause, \nthe church autonomy principle, nor the Free Exercise \nClause.  \n \nAs to the Establishment Clause, the court held \nthat the statutorily required \u201cneutral and secular \ninquiry\u201d into Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities\u201d (App. \n40a\u201341a) does not improperly \u201ccross into an \nevaluation of religious dogma\u201d (App. 38a\u201339a). \nRather, that objective analysis is consistent with the \ninquiry needed for any religious tax exemption laws, \nwhich have been recognized as valid throughout \nAmerican history. App. 41a\u201344a. And the court held \nthat the statute did not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it neither \u201cregulate[d] internal \nchurch governance nor mandate[d] any activity.\u201d App. \n45a\u201346a. Last, the law did not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise \nrights \nbecause \nimposing \na \ngenerally \napplicable tax is not a constitutionally significant \nburden. App. 48a\u201350a. \n \nPetitioners then filed a petition for writ of \ncertiorari with this Court. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n \nWhile Petitioners would like an exemption from \npaying unemployment insurance contributions, they \nhave not satisfied this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari. \nThe state courts are not split on Petitioners\u2019 First \nAmendment challenges, and Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme \nCourt correctly resolved those challenges, in any \nevent. Likewise, there is no state court split on the \nburden for challenges to the validity of state statutes. \n\n7 \n \nAnd even if there was, this case is a poor vehicle to \nresolve it because the issue was not raised below. \nI. \nCertiorari should be denied on the first \nquestion presented. \n \nThis Court should deny the petition on Petitioners\u2019 \nfirst question: whether the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption \nin \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., \nas \ninterpreted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, violates \nthe First Amendment.  \n \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, there is no split \nof authority among the state supreme courts on the \nFirst Amendment claims they present. The many \nstate court cases they discuss consider only how to \ninterpret and apply similar statutory exemptions, not \nwhether those exemptions comply with the First \nAmendment. And Petitioners identify no federal \ncircuit spilt. Without any disagreement among the \nstate courts or lower federal courts, Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional arguments have not percolated enough \nto merit certiorari.  \n \nIn any event, the Wisconsin Supreme Court got it \nright. Courts routinely deny religious tax exemptions \nto entities that assert religious motivations without \noverly entangling themselves in religious matters. \nThat effort does not violate the church autonomy \nprinciple because it does not regulate internal church \ngovernance or compel any activity. And the \nunemployment tax does not violate Petitioners\u2019 free \nexercise rights: it imposes no constitutionally \nsignificant burden on their religious exercise, and it is \na general law that is neutral and nondiscriminatory \non questions of religious belief.  \n\n8 \n \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on  \nthe First Amendment questions \nPetitioner presents. \n \nPetitioners identify no split on the question of \nwhether states may constitutionally consider an \nemployer\u2019s operations, not just its motivations,  \nin deciding whether it is entitled to a religious \nexemption from a state\u2019s unemployment insurance \ntax system.  \n \n1. No high courts have addressed the First \nAmendment issues Petitioners raise here, let alone in \na way that creates a split. \n \nPetitioners cite seven other state high court cases, \nbut \nthose \ncases \nall \ninvolve \nstate \nstatutory \ninterpretation issues, not First Amendment ones. The \ncases all confront similar interpretation questions \nbecause the states copied the language of a federal \nstatute, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), \nwhich establishes a cooperative federal-state program \nof benefits to unemployed workers. See St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. S. Dakota, 451 U.S. \n772, 775 & n.3 (1981); Comm. Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 287 (Iowa 1982). \nFUTA\u2014like \nstate \nstatutes \ncopying \nit\u2014allows \nqualified state unemployment programs to exclude \nnon-profit employers from coverage as to services \nperformed: \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or \n(B) an organization which is operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and which \nis operated, supervised, controlled, or \n\n9 \n \nprincipally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches . . . . \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b).  \n \nBecause many states have adopted that language, \nmultiple state high court decisions discuss what it \nmeans and how to apply it as a matter of state law. \nThat is the issue presented in the cases cited by \nPetitioners\u2014not \nwhether \nthose \nstate \nstatutes \ncomplied with the First Amendment.  \n \nBegin with the four states that Petitioners \nhighlight as supposedly \u201cfocus[ing] on whether an \norganization has sincere religious beliefs indicating \nthat the purpose of its activities is rooted in religious \nmotivation.\u201d Pet. 16. None of them issued a First \nAmendment holding. \n \nIdaho. \nIn \nDepartment \nof \nEmployment \nv. \nChampion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1372 \n(Idaho 1979), Idaho\u2019s high court found only that an \nagency had \u201cerred in its application of the Idaho \nunemployment security law.\u201d It said nothing about \nthe First Amendment. And, as Petitioners candidly \nadmit, Nampa Christian Schools Foundation v. State \nof Idaho, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) relied on \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d and \u201cdid not reach any \nconstitutional questions.\u201d Pet. 17. \n \nIowa. Petitioners also concede that Community \nLutheran School v. Iowa Department of Job Service, \n326 N.W.2d 286 (Iowa 1982) \u201cdid not need to reach\u201d \nany First Amendment questions. Pet. 17. But \nPetitioners\u2019 suggestion that the court construed the \nstatute to \u201cavoid constitutional issues\u201d is inaccurate. \nPet. 17. The court applied ordinary statutory \ninterpretation principles and then, after doing so, \n\n10 \n \nnoted that it did not need to resolve any First \nAmendment questions because it had granted the \nemployer an exemption as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation. Cmty. Lutheran, 326 N.W.2d at 291\u2013\n92. \n \nMaine. In Schwartz v. Unemployment Insurance \nCommission, 895 A.2d 965, 970\u201371 (Me. 2006), \nMaine\u2019s high court never mentioned the First \nAmendment \nand \ninstead \nexamined \nwhether \n\u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d supported a \nfinding of \u201cprimarily religious\u201d purposes.  \n \nMassachusetts. Massachusetts\u2019 high court found \nthat an organization \u201csatisfie[d] the[ ] statutory \nrequirements\u201d of religious purpose. Kendall v. Dir. of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198\u2013200 (Mass. \n1985). In passing, the court mentioned that the \ndefault of construing tax exemptions against the \ntaxpayer does not apply when the \u201cfree exercise of \nreligion\u201d is at issue, id. at 199, but the court never \nfurther analyzed whether denying the exemption \nwould have violated the First Amendment.  \n \nThen turn to the three states (excluding \nWisconsin) that supposedly embody the \u201copposite side \nof the split.\u201d Pet. 21. Like the first four, none of these \nissued a First Amendment holding. \n \nArkansas. Arkansas\u2019 high court denied a \nreligious purpose exemption to a Catholic-affiliated \nhospital based on the court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the \nstatute in a manner separating motivation from \npurpose of operation.\u201d Terwilliger v. St. Vincent \nInfirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Ark. 1991). \nAs Petitioners note, the case cited Lemon v. \nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) and Meek v. \n\n11 \n \nPittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975) once in passing (Pet Br. \n21), but it engaged in no First Amendment analysis \nwhatsoever. \n \nColorado. Petitioners acknowledge that the \nColorado high court in Samaritan Institute v. Prince-\nWalker, 883 P.2d 3 (Colo. 1994) \u201cdid not address any \nconstitutional issues.\u201d Pet. 22. Instead, it addressed \nwhether the lower court had \u201cproperly interpreted the \nphrase \u2018operated primarily for religious purposes\u2019\u201d \nand denied the exemption to a counseling center. \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 4. \n \nMaryland. Again, Petitioners concede that \nMaryland\u2019s high court in Employment Security \nAssociation v. Lutheran High School Association,  \n436 A.2d 481 (Md. 1981) \u201cchose not to address the \nconstitutional issues presented.\u201d Pet. 23. Like the \nothers, the court instead addressed what \u201cfactors may \nappropriately be taken into account\u201d in the religious \npurposes analysis. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, 436 \nA.2d at 487.1 \n \n1 The intermediate state appellate court decisions \nPetitioners cite on both sides of the \u201csplit\u201d likewise did  \nnot involve First Amendment holdings. See By The Hand  \nClub for Kids, NFP, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Emp. Sec., 188 N.E.3d  \n1196, 1198, 1214 (Ill. App. 2020) (evaluating whether  \nreligious afterschool program qualified for Illinois\u2019  \nexemption without \u201creach[ing] the parties\u2019 constitutional \narguments\u201d); Cathedral Arts Project, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Econ. \nOpportunity, 95 So.3d 970, 973 (Fla. App. 2012) \n(examining whether children\u2019s art program qualified for \nFlorida\u2019s exemption); Czigler v. Administrator, 501 N.E.2d \n56, 57 (Ohio App. 1985) (evaluating whether religious \nschool qualified for Ohio\u2019s exemption and mentioning only \n\n12 \n \n \nBecause there is no split on a federal question, \ncertiorari should be denied. This Court does not \nresolve questions of how states interpret their own \nlaws. See Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916 (1997) \n(\u201cNeither this Court nor any other federal tribunal \nhas any authority to place a construction on a state \nstatute different from the one rendered by the highest \ncourt of the State.\u201d). \n \n2. Even on the statutory interpretation question \nof how to construe and apply the \u201creligious purpose\u201d \nexemption, the split that Petitioners posit does not \nreally exist. \n \nAmong the cases Petitioners describe as residing \non their side of the ledger (Pet. 16\u201320), it is true that \nthe courts held the entities were operated \u201cprimarily \nfor a religious purpose\u201d and thus entitled to the \nstatutory exemption. But that is because the specific \nfacts in those four cases justified this result, not \nbecause the courts applied a different test from the \nones on Respondents\u2019 side of the ledger. More to the \npoint, none of the cases on Petitioners\u2019 side looked at \nthe entity\u2019s motivation alone\u2014they all also looked to \nsome degree at the entity\u2019s activities, just like \nWisconsin\u2019s supreme court did here. \n \nIdaho. In Champion Bake-N-Serve, Inc., the \nIdaho court held that services provided by students at \na religious college in a church-run bakery qualified for \nthe exemption because it was part of their religious \ntraining; services provided by regular fulltime \nemployees at the same bakery did not qualify.  \n \nin passing \u201cpotentially serious entanglement by the state \nin violation of the Establishment Clause\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n592 P.2d at 1371\u201372. And in Nampa Christian \nSchools Foundation, the Idaho Supreme Court held \nthat the statutory language required the court to look \nat an organization\u2019s operations, not just its \nmotivations. 719 P.2d at 1180. \n \nIowa. In Community Lutheran School, the court \nlooked at the operations of the school, including the \nincorporation of Lutheran faith into \u201cevery aspect of \nall classes.\u201d 326 N.W. 2d at 291. The curriculum \ninvolved \u201c[s]pecific religious instruction,\u201d \u201creligious \nceremonies [were] held throughout the day,\u201d and \nteachers had to be Lutherans. Id. The school was not \nengaged in otherwise secular activity motivated by a \nreligious purpose. \n \nMaine. \nIn \nSchwartz, \nthe \ncourt \nexamined \noperational facts including how the entity \u201c[brought] \npastors to island communities to lead religious \nservices and provide religious counseling,\u201d paid for \nminister salaries, and had otherwise \u201cmaintained its \nreligious emphasis and function.\u201d 895 A.2d at 970. \n \nMassachusetts. In Kendall, the court rejected a \nrule that would grant exemptions only to schools \n\u201cdevoted to religious instruction.\u201d 473 N.E.2d at 199. \nBut the court noted how the school was \u201coperated in \naccordance \nwith \nchurch \nprinciples,\u201d \nprovided \n\u201c[c]lasses in religious education,\u201d and held \u201cSaturday \nmass . . . for the school\u2019s resident students.\u201d Id. \nPetitioners repeatedly point to Kendall, but it did not \nrely on religious motivations alone.2 \n \n2 The intermediate state appellate cases Petitioners \ncite similarly considered operational facts, not just \nmotivations. By The Hand Club for Kids, NFP, Inc.,  \n\n14 \n \n \nAll told, none of those state cases hold that an \norganization\u2019s motivation alone is sufficient to qualify \nfor the \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \nexemption. \n \nThis analytical approach is consistent with the \ncongressional history of FUTA, which many state \ncourts have looked to in construing their statutes. See \nSamaritan Inst., 883 P.2d at 7; Terwilliger, 304 \nS.W.2d at 698; Sugar Plum Tree Nursery Sch. v. Iowa \nDep\u2019t of Job Serv., 285 N.W.2d 23, 24\u201325 (Iowa 1979). \nThat history provides examples of what the exception \nencompasses:   \nA college devoted primarily to preparing \nstudents for the ministry would be exempt, \nas would a novitiate or a house of study \ntraining candidates to become members of \nreligious orders. On the other hand, a \nchurch related (separately incorporated) \ncharitable organization (such as, for \nexample, an orphanage or home for the \naged) would not be considered under this \nparagraph to be operated primarily for \nreligious purposes. \n \n188 N.E.3d at 1208\u201309 (afterschool program qualified for \nexemption based on executive director\u2019s religious goals; \ngoverning documents; control of key staff appointments \nand assets by the church; requirement that all staff adhere \nto a religious doctrinal statement and regularly attend \nchurch; a \u201cpervasive Bible-based program content that \nincludes evangelical study material\u201d; and frequent prayer); \nCzigler, 501 N.E.2d at 58 (religious school qualified where \nstudents recognized Jewish holidays, studied Hebrew and \nreligion, and were of the Jewish faith). \n\n15 \n \nS.Rep.No.752, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 48-49 (1970); \nH.R.Rep.No.612, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1969)) \n(quoted in St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran, 451 U.S. \nat 781). Those examples\u2014especially the \u201corphanage \nor home for the aged\u201d charitable organizations that \nare merely \u201cchurch related\u201d\u2014demonstrate how state \ncourts are correctly taking the entity\u2019s operations into \naccount. \n \nPetitioners thus offer this Court no developed \ndisagreement among state courts at all, much less one \non a federal constitutional issue. As a result, the issue \nthey present is not appropriate for this Court\u2019s \nconsideration. \nB. \nThe decision below follows directly \nfrom this Court\u2019s precedents. \n \nThe Petition also does not warrant certiorari \nbecause the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly \napplied this Court\u2019s precedents.  \n \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nWisconsin\u2019s \nstatute \nviolates the First Amendment in three ways: (1) by \nrequiring Wisconsin courts to conduct an \u201cintrusive \ninquiry into the operations of religious organizations\u201d; \n(2) by violating the church autonomy principle, \nthrough \u201cpenalizing\u201d its creation of charitable entities \nseparate from the Church; and (3) by abandoning the \nprinciple of neutrality through denying an exemption \nto religious organizations that structure themselves \ndifferently. See Pet. 23\u201331. This Court\u2019s precedents do \nnot support those claims. \n \n1. The Wisconsin statute, interpreted to require \nan examination of \u201cboth the motives and the activities \nof the organization\u201d seeking an exemption, does not \n\n16 \n \nrequire excessive government entanglement with \nreligion. App. 28a. In Walz v. Tax Commission of  \nthe City of New York, this Court recognized the \nunremarkable principle that granting exemptions \nfrom taxation \u201coccasions some degree of involvement \nwith religion.\u201d 397 U.S. 664, 674 (1970). As Justice \nHarlan explained in his concurrence, \u201cevaluating the \nscope of charitable activities in proportion to doctrinal \npursuits may be difficult,\u201d but that difficulty \u201cdoes not \nrender the interference undue so long as it \u201cdoes not \nentail judicial inquiry into dogma and belief.\u201d Id. at \n697 n.1 (Harlan, J., concurring).  \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court did not cross that \nline. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court never \u201csecond-guess[ed]\u201d Catholic \nCharities\u2019 \u201cbelief that what it did was filled with \nreligious purpose.\u201d Pet. 28. Rather, the Court \n\u201caccept[ed] these [beliefs] at face value\u201d and did not \nfind Catholic Charities\u2019 asserted religious motivations \nto be \u201cinsincere, fraudulent, or otherwise not \ncredible.\u201d App. 28a\u201329a. And it engaged in \u201cno \nexamination of whether CCB\u2019s or the sub-entities\u2019 \nactivities are consistent or inconsistent with Catholic \ndoctrine.\u201d App. 40a. Instead, the Court relied on the \norganization\u2019s \u201cprimarily charitable and secular\u201d \nactivities, and especially how the \u201cservices provided \nwould not differ in any sense\u201d whether provided by an \norganization with religious or secular motivations. \nApp. \n30a\u201331a. \nThat \ndoes \nnot \nrepresent \nan \n\u201cinquisition\u201d into religious beliefs (Pet. 28); it is \nexactly what Congress suggested should be done to \ndetermine whether a religious purpose is \u201cprimary.\u201d \nSee H.R. Rep. No. 91-612, at 44 (1969). \n\n17 \n \n \n2. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also followed \nthis Court\u2019s precedents in determining that its \ninterpretation of state law did not violate the church \nautonomy principle. This Court held in Kedroff v. St. \nNicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in \nNorth America, 344 U.S. 94, 119 (1952), that states \nmay not determine questions of religious governance. \nThere, the state court had adjudicated a dispute \nbetween two branches of the Russian Orthodox \nchurch and ordered that New York churches \nrecognize the governing body of one of those branches. \nId. at 99 n.3. This Court held that the state violated \nautonomy principles by \u201cdisplac[ing] one church \nadministrator with another . . . [and] pass[ing] the \ncontrol of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one \nchurch authority to another.\u201d Id. at 119. \n \nThis case is nothing like the decision invalidated \nin Kedroff. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment insurance law \nneither requires nor prohibits any particular religious \ngovernance structure or leadership. Rather, it \n\u201cdefines what employment is for the purposes of \nunemployment insurance without reference to any \nreligious principles or any attempt to control internal \nchurch operations.\u201d App. 45a\u201346a. That \u201cdoes not \nconcern matters that are \u2018strictly\u2019 or even remotely \n\u2018ecclesiastical,\u2019 which belong to the church alone.\u201d \nApp. 45a\u201346a.  \n \n \n3. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also rightly \nfound no violation of the neutrality principle under \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. A free exercise challenge \nrequires the claimant to show that his religious \nexercise was significantly burdened and that the law \nis not \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cgenerally applicable.\u201d Kennedy v. \nBremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 (2022). The \n\n18 \n \nstate court here correctly held that Petitioners failed \nat the first step of showing a constitutionally \nsignificant burden. \n \nA free exercise clause claimant must demonstrate \nthat the challenged law burdens their freedom to \nexercise religion in a significant or substantial way: \n\u201c[i]t is virtually self-evident that the Free Exercise \nClause does not require an exemption from a \ngovernmental program unless, at a minimum, \ninclusion in the program actually burdens the \nclaimant\u2019s freedom to exercise religious rights.\u201d Tony \n& Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, 471 U.S. \n290, 303 (1985).   \n \nThe Wisconsin court held that Petitioners had \nfailed to show that the unemployment insurance \nstatute burdened their religious beliefs. App. 49a. The \nstate law did not prohibit Petitioners from engaging \nin any religious activity and, despite participating for \nmany years in the unemployment insurance program, \nthey did not contend that it significantly or \nsubstantially burdened their religious practices or \nbeliefs. App. 49a. \n \nThat holding is consistent with cases like Jimmy \nSwaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization of \nCalifornia, 493 U.S. 378, 391 (1990), which held that \nthe financial impacts of state taxation schemes on an \nentity\u2019s religious activities are not \u201cconstitutionally \nsignificant.\u201d  \n \nSuch taxation regimes are unlike the laws in the \ncases Petitioners rely on here. Pet. 24. The ordinance \nin Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532 (1993), denied one \ndenomination the ability to pray in a park but allowed \n\n19 \n \nit for others; the criminal conviction for Bible talks in \na public park in Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, \n272\u201373 (1951), similarly burdened that group\u2019s free \nexercise right; and the law in Larson v. Valente, 456 \nU.S. 228, 247 n.23 (1982), forced a denomination to \nregister and be regulated as a charity based on its  \ndonor base. Tax exemptions for groups that engage in \nreligious activities, in contrast, do not force ineligible \ngroups to do anything and do not burden their free \nexercise rights. \n \nHere, Petitioners failed to show how \u201cthe payment \nof unemployment tax prevents them from fulfilling \nany religious function or engaging in any religious \nactivities.\u201d App. 50a. That defeats their argument, \nwhether \nunder \nthe \nFree \nExercise \nor \nthe \nEstablishment Clause. \n \nII. \nCertiorari should be denied on the second \nquestion presented. \n \nPetitioners also ask the Court to resolve a \nsupposed split regarding the burden to overcome the \npresumption \nof \nconstitutionality \nafforded \nto \nlegislative \nenactments \nwhen \nchallenging \nthe \nconstitutionality of a statute. \n \nThis split is illusory, too. This Court and every \nstate\u2019s highest court, save Alaska\u2019s, has articulated \nthis presumption by saying that a challenger must \nshow beyond a reasonable doubt that a statute is \nunconstitutional. \nOther \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption have been used too\u2014by the same courts, \nand even in the same cases\u2014but these represent mere \nrhetorical variation, not substantive differences in \nthe presumption. Petitioners have failed to point to a \n\n20 \n \nsingle case where the choice of one formulation of the \npresumption over another made a difference in the \noutcome.  \n \nAnd even if a substantive, outcome-determinative \nsplit existed, this case presents a poor vehicle to \nresolve it. The courts below dedicated only one \nparagraph of discussion to the issue, in a dissent. This \nlack of development resulted from Petitioners\u2019 failure \nto raise the issue at any point before their petition for \ncertiorari. The issue has therefore not been \nconsidered below in a way that tees it up for this \nCourt\u2019s consideration. \nA. \nNo split of authority exists on the \npresumption-of-constitutionality \nquestion Petitioners present. \n \nPetitioners tell the Court that the decision below \nreinforced a split that exists over the proper standard \nfor the judicial review of statutes. Pet. 31. Petitioners \npoint out that the Wisconsin Supreme Court, along \nwith the high courts of several other states, \nsometimes says that a party challenging a statute on \nconstitutional \ngrounds \nmust \nshow \nits \nunconstitutionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. \nat 33\u201334. Petitioners assert that this is a higher \nstandard than that used by other state high courts \nand \nthe \nfederal \ncourts, \nwhich \nrequire \nthat \nunconstitutionality \nbe \n\u201cclearly\u201d \nor \n\u201cplain[ly]\u201d \ndemonstrated. Id. at 31\u201333.  \n \nThere is no such split. Any difference Petitioners \nidentify is merely a rhetorical one over how to refer to \nthe \npresumption \nof \nconstitutionality \nafforded \nstatutes. This presumption is one courts, both federal \n\n21 \n \nand state, have unanimously adopted when deciding \nconstitutional challenges to statutes. See Christopher \nR. Green, Clarity and Reasonable Doubt in Early \nState-Constitutional Judicial Review, 57 S. Tex. L. \nRev. 169, 172\u201382 (2015). \n \nAll courts (including this one), save Alaska\u2019s, have \nexpressed the presumption of constitutionality by \nsaying that a challenger must show beyond a \nreasonable doubt that a statute is unconstitutional. \nGreen, supra, at 172, 179\u201382 (2015); e.g., Adkins v. \nChildren\u2019s Hosp., 261 U.S. 525, 544 (1923) (\u201cThis \ncourt, by an unbroken line of decisions from Chief \nJustice Marshall to the present day, has steadily \nadhered to the rule that every possible presumption \nis in favor of the validity of an act of Congress until \novercome beyond rational doubt.\u201d). \n \nAnd \nall \ncourts \nhave \nalso \nexpressed \nthe \npresumption \nby \nsaying \nthe \nshowing \nof \nunconstitutionality must be clear, plain, or manifest. \nGreen, supra, at 176\u2013178; e.g., United States v. \nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000) (\u201cDue respect for \nthe decisions of a coordinate branch of Government \ndemands \nthat \nwe \ninvalidate \na \ncongressional \nenactment only upon a plain showing that Congress \nhas exceeded its constitutional bounds.\u201d). Sometimes \nthese formulations of the presumption\u2014call them the \nclarity formulations\u2014appear in the same case as the \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation. See, e.g., \nState v. Kahalewai, 541 P.2d 1020, 1024 (Haw. 1975) \n(holding that the showing of unconstitutionality must \nbe \u201cclear and convincing\u201d and \u201cbeyond all reasonable \ndoubt\u201d). In fact, seven states adopted the two \nformulations in the same case. Green, supra, at 185 \n\n22 \n \n(New York, Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, Rhode \nIsland, Idaho, and Utah). \n \nSome state courts, including Wisconsin\u2019s, prefer a \nparticular formulation of the presumption. E.g., App. \n37a. Other state courts and the federal courts \ncontinue to use both the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nand clarity formulations. Compare Dutra v. Trs. of \nBoston Univ., 96 F.4th 15 (1st Cir. 2024) (\u201cA \nlegislative enactment carries with it a presumption of \nconstitutionality, and the challenging party must \ndemonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that there \nare no \u2018conceivable grounds\u2019 which could support its \nvalidity.\u201d (citations omitted)), with United States v. \nAnderson, 771 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir. 2014) (\u201c\u2018[A] general \nreticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation\u2019s elected \nleaders\u2019 and \u2018proper respect for a coordinate branch of \nthe government\u2019 requires that a federal court strike \ndown an Act of Congress only if \u2018the lack of \nconstitutional authority to pass the act in question is \nclearly demonstrated.\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)). And still \nothers use a mash-up of the two. E.g. State v. \nCrawford, 478 S.W.2d 314, 316 (Mo. 1972) (\u201cA statute \nis presumed to be constitutional and will not be \ndeclared unconstitutional unless it clearly and \nundoubtedly violates some constitutional provision.\u201d) \n \nIn short, the clarity and beyond-a-reasonable-\ndoubt formulations are just different ways of naming \nthe same presumption\u2014they are \u201calternative verbal \nformulations of the same rule.\u201d Green, supra, at 171, \n184, 186 (referring to the two formulations as \n\u201csynonymous\u201d and \u201cprecedentially interchangeable\u201d). \nIndeed, \u201c[t]o be clearly and truly convinced is to lack \nany reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 188 (citation omitted). \n\n23 \n \n \nPetitioners wrongly suggest that the beyond-a-\nreasonable-doubt formulation places a \nheavier \nburden on a party challenging a statute than the \nclarity formulations do. Pet. 35\u201336. Any difference  \nis rhetorical. Hugh Spitzer, Reasoning v. Rhetoric:  \nThe Strange Case of \u201cUnconstitutional Beyond a \nReasonable Doubt\u201d, 74 Rutgers U. L. Rev. 1429,  \n(2022) (noting that the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulation is a \u201crhetorical commitment to judicial \ndeference\u201d (alteration omitted) (citation omitted); \nIsland County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 384, 393 (Wash. \n1998) (Talmadge, J., concurring) (referring to same as \n\u201csimply a hortatory expression, a guide for our \nconsideration, a reminder that the Legislature\u2014not \nthe Court\u2014is the body the people of our state have \nchosen to make their laws\u201d). \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, among other state \nhigh courts, has said as much. In Mayo v. Wisconsin \nInjured Patients and Families Compensation Fund, \nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]n the \ncontext of a challenge to a statute\u2019s constitutionality, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt expresses the force or \nconviction with which a court must conclude, as a \nmatter of law, that a statute is unconstitutional \nbefore the statute . . . can be set aside.\u201d 914 N.W.2d \n678, 689 (Wis. 2018) (citation omitted); Spitzer,  \nsupra, at 1452 (interpreting this line in Mayo as \n\u201cessentially converting the [beyond-a-reasonable-\ndoubt] formulation into a rhetorical flourish meant to \nemphasize that the justices should have a high degree \nof \nconfidence \nof \nunconstitutionality \nprior \nto \ninvalidating a statute\u201d). In other words, \u201cbeyond a \nreasonable doubt\u201d in the judicial-review context is not \nthe high burden of proof it represents in the criminal-\n\n24 \n \nlaw context. See In re Commitment of Alger,  \n858 N.W.2d 346, 353\u201354 (Wis. 2015) (distinguishing \n\u201cunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d from \n\u201cprobably unconstitutional\u201d). \n \nThe substantive similarity between the clarity and \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption accounts for why Petitioners cannot \npoint to a single case in which a choice among them \nhad any effect on the outcome. Accord Island County, \n955 P.2d at 393 (Talmadge, J., concurring) (\u201cI have \nnot heard a judge say, and I have not read a case that \nsays, \u2018I believe this statute is clearly and convincingly \nunconstitutional, but I am not persuaded it is \nunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d).  \n \nContrary \nto \nPetitioners\u2019 \nclaim \nthat \nthe  \nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation \u201cthreatens \nconstitutional rights,\u201d (Pet. 35), the judicial and \nscholarly consensus is that the formulation is \u201cnot a \npresumption or doctrine that drives the outcome of \ncases.\u201d Spitzer, supra, at 1433. This case is in line \nwith that consensus: both the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that their \nshared interpretation of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 \npassed constitutional muster, but only the former \nused the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt formulation. \nCompare App. 50a, with App. 162a. \n \nIn sum, there is no split. Rather, different states \nhave \ndeveloped \nvarious \nformulations \nof \nthe \npresumption of constitutionality. In practice, the \nsuperficial differences in the wording of various \nformulations are just that\u2014disguises for a \u201cvery \nstrong consensus\u201d among courts on how to apply the \n\n25 \n \npresumption of constitutionality. Green, supra, at \n197. \nB. \nEven if a split of authority existed, \nthis case would be a poor vehicle for \nthis Court to resolve it. \n \nThis Court typically will not address issues that \nwere not raised below. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. \n19, 34 (2001) (\u201cWe do not reach this issue because it \nwas not raised or briefed below.\u201d); E.E.O.C. v. Fed. \nLabor Relations Auth., 476 U.S. 19, 24 (dismissing \nwrit of certiorari as improvidently granted because \nissues were not raised below).  \n \nPetitioners concede that they failed to raise below \ntheir challenge to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nformulation of the presumption of constitutionality. \nPet. 36. As a result, there was but one paragraph of \ndiscussion, in a dissent, about the standard. App. \n93a\u201394a.

It moves beyond the preparatory steps of searching and thinking to the final, evaluable product. Seeing the agent's ultimate conclusion and the reasoning behind it provides the most significant insight into whether it has successfully analyzed this specific case. The preceding steps hint at the agent's direction, but only the final response confirms its ability to complete the task.\n\n**Design EIG is high (0.9)** because the final response serves as a holistic test of the agent's entire design and strategy. By examining the quality of the final prediction\u2014its legal accuracy, the precedents cited, and the coherence of its argument\u2014I can assess the effectiveness of the `search -> think -> synthesize` workflow. A strong response validates the design, while a weak one provides crucial diagnostic information about where the process failed (e.g., inadequate search, flawed reasoning, poor synthesis). This is the most important data point for evaluating and improving the agent's general prediction strategy.\n\n**Joint EIG is therefore very high (1.8)** as this single action provides a comprehensive assessment of the agent's performance at both the task and design levels.",
