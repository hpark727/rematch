    "facts_of_the_case": "The Surface Transportation Board (STB) granted a petition from the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition to construct and operate an 80-mile railway in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin. The railway\u2019s primary purpose would be to transport waxy crude oil from the basin to the national rail network. The STB conducted an environmental review process, including the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Board issued a final decision in December 2021, authorizing the construction and operation of the railway subject to environmental mitigation conditions.\n\nIn its environmental analysis, the STB considered various impacts of the railway\u2019s construction and operation within the project area, including effects on water resources, air quality, special status species, land use, and local economies. However, the Board declined to analyze certain \u201cdownline impacts\u201d\u2014effects from increased train traffic on existing rail lines beyond the new railway. The STB also omitted analysis of other potential environmental effects, such as increased crude oil refining impacts on Gulf Coast communities, upline impacts of increased drilling in the Uinta Basin, and downline effects of potential oil spills along the Colorado River. Finally, the Board did not disclose the potential effects of the project on historic sites or structures along the Union Pacific line in Eagle County. The Board justified these omissions by arguing that minimal increases in train traffic on existing lines were unlikely to cause significant impacts, and that some effects were beyond the scope of its regulatory authority.\n\nEagle County asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the Board\u2019s orders, and the granted the petitions in part, denied them in part, and vacated the underlying order.",

Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004), this Court held that when \nan agency cannot prevent an environmental effect \n\u201cdue to its limited statutory authority over the rele-\nvant actions,\u201d the National Environmental Policy Act \ndoes not require it to study that effect. This holding \nhas divided the courts of appeals. Five circuits read \nPublic Citizen to mean that an agency\u2019s environmen-\ntal review can stop where its regulatory authority \nstops. Two circuits disagree and require review of any \nimpact that can be called reasonably foreseeable. \nHere, the Surface Transportation Board relied on \nPublic Citizen to cabin its environmental review of a \nnew rail line in Utah. But the D.C. Circuit rejected \nthat approach, ruling that the Board \u201ccannot avoid\u201d \nenvironmental review \u201con the ground that it lacks au-\nthority to prevent, control, or mitigate\u201d distant envi-\nronmental effects. As a result, it ordered the Board to \nstudy the local effects of oil wells and refineries that \nlie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory authority. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the National Environmental Policy Act  \nrequires an agency to study environmental impacts  \nbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which \nthe agency has regulatory authority. \n \n \n\n \n \nii\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING  \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nThis petition seeks review of two cases that were \nconsolidated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In \nthis Court, Petitioners are the Seven County Infra-\nstructure Coalition and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC. \nRespondents in this Court who were petitioners in the \ncourt of appeals are Eagle County, Colorado, the Cen-\nter for Biological Diversity, Living Rivers, Sierra \nClub, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, \nand WildEarth Guardians. Respondents in this Court \nwho were respondents in the court of appeals are the \nSurface Transportation Board, the United States of \nAmerica, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \nPetitioner Seven County Infrastructure Coalition is \nan independent political subdivision of the State of \nUtah. Its member counties are Carbon, Daggett, \nDuchesne, Emery, San Juan, Sevier, and Uintah. It \nhas no parent corporation, nor does it issue shares \nheld by any publicly traded company. \nPetitioner Uinta Basin Railway, LLC is a limited \nliability company organized and existing in the state \nof Delaware. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uinta \nBasin Railway Holdings, LLC, which is an affiliate of \nDHIP Group, LP. Neither Uinta Basin Railway Hold-\nings, LLC nor DHIP Group, LP issues securities to the \npublic, and no publicly held company has a 10% or \ngreater ownership interest in either Uinta Basin Rail-\nway Holdings, LLC or DHIP Group, LP. \n \n \n\n \n \niii\nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises from the following proceedings: \n\uf0b7 Eagle County, Colorado v.

This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C) (2019) provides: \nThe Congress authorizes and directs that, to the \nfullest extent possible: (1) the policies, regulations, \nand public laws of the United States shall be inter-\npreted and administered in accordance with the poli-\ncies set forth in this chapter, and (2) all agencies of the \nFederal Government shall\u2014 \n(C) include in every recommendation or report on \nproposals for legislation and other major Federal ac-\ntions significantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment, a detailed statement by the responsible \nofficial on\u2014 \n\n \n \n2\n(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, \n(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot \nbe avoided should the proposal be implemented, \n(iii) alternatives to the proposed action, \n(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses \nof man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and en-\nhancement of long-term productivity, and \n(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments \nof resources which would be involved in the proposed \naction should it be implemented. \nPrior to making any detailed statement, the re-\nsponsible Federal official shall consult with and ob-\ntain the comments of any Federal agency which has \njurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to \nany environmental impact involved. Copies of such \nstatement and the comments and views of appropriate \nFederal, State, and local agencies, which are author-\nized to develop and enforce environmental standards, \nshall be made available to the President, the Council \non Environmental Quality and to the public as pro-\nvided in section 552 of title 5, and shall accompany the \nproposal through the existing agency review pro-\ncesses[.] \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8 (2019) provides: \nEffects include: \n(a) Direct effects, which are caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place. \n(b) Indirect effects, which are caused by the action \nand are later in time or farther removed in distance, \nbut are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects \nmay include growth inducing effects and other effects \nrelated to induced changes in the pattern of land use, \n\n \n \n3\npopulation density or growth rate, and related effects \non air and water and other natural systems, including \necosystems. \nEffects and impacts as used in these regulations \nare synonymous. Effects include ecological (such as \nthe effects on natural resources and on the compo-\nnents, structures, and functioning of affected ecosys-\ntems) aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or \nhealth, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative). Ef-\nfects may also include those resulting from actions \nwhich may have both beneficial and detrimental ef-\nfects, even if on balance the agency believes that the \neffect will be beneficial. \n \n \n\n \n \n4\nINTRODUCTION \nThis case presents a circuit split over the meaning \nof Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752 (2004). That decision held that \u201cwhere an \nagency has no ability to prevent\u201d an environmental ef-\nfect \u201cdue to its limited statutory authority over the rel-\nevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a le-\ngally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d Id. at 770. Hence, \nthe agency need not study that effect in its National \nEnvironmental Policy Act review. Id. \nMost circuits see Public Citizen as tying the scope \nof an agency\u2019s NEPA review to the limits of that \nagency\u2019s regulatory authority. As the Sixth Circuit \nput it, \u201cagencies may reasonably limit their NEPA re-\nview to only those effects proximately caused by the \nactions over which they have regulatory responsibil-\nity.\u201d Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng\u2019rs, 746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014). \nThus, the \u201cline between those causal changes that \nmay make an actor responsible for an effect and those \nthat do not\u201d will \u201capproximate the limits of an \nagency\u2019s area of control.\u201d N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Protection \nv. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 (3d \nCir. 2009). In other words, an \u201cagency is on the hook\u201d \nunder Public Citizen \u201conly for the decisions that it has \nthe authority to make.\u201d Protect Our Parks v. Buttigieg, \n39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022). \nBut the D.C. Circuit takes a conflicting view. It \nreads Public Citizen as turning \u201cnot on the question \n\u2018What activities does [the agency] regulate,\u2019\u201d but on \nthe agency\u2019s power to block a project that \u201cwould be \ntoo harmful to the environment.\u201d Sierra Club v. FERC \n(Sabal Trail), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nOn this view, agencies must consider even those dis-\ntant environmental effects that are another agency\u2019s \n\n \n \n5\nresponsibility: \u201c[T]he existence of permit require-\nments overseen by another federal agency or state \npermitting authority cannot substitute for a proper \nNEPA analysis.\u201d Id. at 1375. \nThe Eleventh Circuit has expressly rejected the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201coutlier\u201d view, criticizing its sister cir-\ncuit for \u201cfailing to take seriously the rule in Public Cit-\nizen\u201d and ignoring \u201cthe untenable consequences of its \ndecision.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1299\u20131300 (11th Cir. \n2019). Like the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits, the Eleventh Circuit holds that when an agency \n\u201clacks the authority to regulate\u201d an effect \u201cwholesale,\u201d \nPublic Citizen does not require the agency to consider \nthat effect. Id. at 1294. The Eleventh Circuit also re-\njected the D.C. Circuit\u2019s NEPA-based dismissal of \nother agencies\u2019 oversight, holding instead that an en-\nvironmental review may exclude \u201cdistantly caused ef-\nfects\u201d that are subject to \u201cindependent regulatory \nschemes.\u201d Id. at 1292. \nThe decision here shows why the D.C. Circuit is on \nthe wrong side of this conflict. Petitioners want to \nbuild a new 88-mile common carrier rail line that \nwould link an isolated part of Utah to the national rail \nnetwork. They sought and received the Surface Trans-\nportation Board\u2019s approval to do so. But when oppo-\nnents of Petitioners\u2019 project challenged it in the D.C. \nCircuit, they said nothing about the proximate effects \nof the 88-mile line that the Board had approved. In-\nstead, they argued that the Board should have done \nmore to study the distant effects of the main commod-\nity that the rail line would carry\u2014waxy crude oil. \nIn approving the rail line, the Board had explained \nthat it lacked \u201cauthority or jurisdiction over develop-\nment of oil and gas\u201d and could not \u201ccontrol or mitigate \n\n \n \n6\nthe impacts of any such development.\u201d Pet.App.108a. \nThus, the Board reasoned, those impacts were not in-\ndirect effects of the rail line under Public Citizen. \nPet.App.108a. The D.C. Circuit held otherwise: \u201cThe \nBoard [] cannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA \nto identify and describe the environmental effects of \nincreased oil drilling and refining on the ground that \nit lacks authority to prevent, control, or mitigate those \ndevelopments.\u201d Pet.App.36a. Under this rule, the \nBoard had to consider not only the effects of the new \nrail line it was permitting in Utah, but also the hypo-\nthetical, localized effects of processing the oil carried \non the line at separately regulated Gulf Coast refiner-\nies a thousand miles away. Pet.App.36a\u201337a. \nBy requiring an agency to consider any environ-\nmental effect that it has the power to prevent, no mat-\nter the limits of its regulatory authority, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s rule turns each agency into a \u201cde facto environ-\nmental-policy czar.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 941 \nF.3d at 1299. To avoid that outcome, the last admin-\nistration adopted new NEPA rules that relied on Pub-\nlic Citizen to limit the scope of agency environmental \nreview. See 85 Fed. Reg. 43304, 43344 (July 16, 2020). \nBut just two years later, a new administration re-\nversed course, abandoned the majority reading of \nPublic Citizen, and reinstated the old NEPA rules. See \n87 Fed. Reg. 23453, 23464 (Apr. 20, 2022). These du-\neling White House interpretations of Public Citizen \nunderscore the reasons for review here. Agencies need \na manageable line to guide their NEPA studies, and \nthis Court is now the only place to find one. \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe National Environmental Policy Act makes \u201ca \nbroad national commitment to protecting and promot-\ning environmental quality.\u201d Robertson v. Methow Val-\nley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989). To ful-\nfill that commitment, NEPA requires agencies to pre-\npare a report that \u201ctake[s] a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the environ-\nmental consequences\u201d of their actions. Baltimore Gas \n& Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, 97 \n(1983). But \u201cNEPA itself does not mandate particular \nresults,\u201d only \u201cthe necessary process\u201d for considering \nthe environmental effects of agency action. Robertson, \n490 U.S. at 350. Because this environmental review \nprocess can become an end in itself, the Court from \ntime-to-time has had to step in to draw \u201c[c]ommon \nsense\u201d boundaries. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power \nCorp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 \n(1978). This case should be another one of those times. \nA. Legal Background \nPublic Citizen illustrates how this Court has im-\nposed common sense on the NEPA process. The \nCourt\u2019s decision started by emphasizing that NEPA\u2019s \n\u201cprocedural requirements\u201d have \u201ca particular focus on \nrequiring agencies to undertake analyses of the envi-\nronmental impact of their proposals and actions.\u201d 541 \nU.S. at 756\u201357. The Court then turned to the facts be-\nfore it, which involved the President\u2019s decision to lift \na longstanding moratorium on Mexican motor carriers \noperating in the United States. Id. 759. Before that \ndecision could take effect, the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration had to promulgate new safety \nrules for the Mexican carriers. Id. at 760. But that was \nall FMCSA could do. It had \u201cno statutory authority to \nimpose or enforce emissions controls or to establish \n\n \n \n8\nenvironmental requirements unrelated to motor car-\nrier safety.\u201d Id. at 759. \nBecause FMCSA\u2019s role was limited to enforcing mo-\ntor carrier safety, its NEPA review \u201cdid not consider \nany environmental impact that might be caused by \nthe increased presence of Mexican trucks within the \nUnited States.\u201d Id. at 761. Yet when FMCSA\u2019s safety \nrules were challenged, the court of appeals found that \nthe agency\u2019s NEPA review had \u201cfailed to give ade-\nquate consideration to the overall environmental im-\npact of lifting the moratorium\u201d on Mexican trucks. Id. \nat 762. \nThis Court unanimously reversed. In so doing, the \nCourt recognized that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for \nMexican trucks to operate in the United States until \nFMCSA issued its rules. Id. at 765. Still, it found that \nthose rules were not the \u201ccause\u201d of the trucks\u2019 overall \nimpact. Id. at 765\u201367. The Court based this finding on \nthe principle that \u201cNEPA requires \u2018a reasonably close \ncausal relationship\u2019 between the environmental effect \nand the alleged cause.\u201d Id. at 767 (quoting Metro. Ed-\nison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983)). \u201cBut for\u201d causation was not enough. \nId. And since FMCSA lacked the \u201cability categorically \nto prevent\u201d trucks from entering the country, it did not \ncause the environmental effects of those trucks\u2019 \n\u201ccross-border operations.\u201d Id. at 768. The Court sum-\nmarized its holding this way: \u201c[W]here an agency has \nno ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited \nstatutory authority over the relevant actions, the \nagency cannot be considered the legally relevant \n\u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d Id. at 770. \n\n \n \n9\nB. Factual Background \nPublic Citizen was central to the Surface Transpor-\ntation Board\u2019s decision to authorize construction and \noperation of the new rail line here\u2014the Uinta Basin \nRailway. That railway will serve the Uinta Basin, a \n12,000-square-mile area in northeast Utah and north-\nwest Colorado that is isolated by the mountain ranges \nand plateaus of the western Rockies. Though the ba-\nsin is about the same size as Maryland, the only way \nto reach it today is over two-lane roads that cross high \nmountain passes. This inaccessibility makes it hard \nfor people living in the basin to participate in the \nbroader economy. \nIf the basin were less isolated, it would change peo-\nple\u2019s lives. The basin is filled with untapped natural \nresources, including valuable minerals, natural gas, \nand waxy crude oil. The basin\u2019s farmers and ranchers \ngrow alfalfa, corn, and cattle. But without better in-\nfrastructure, these products can never reach the rest \nof the country. At the same time, products from the \nrest of the country cannot easily reach the people liv-\ning in the basin. These chokepoints raise costs for eve-\nryone, blocking diverse trade and throttling the ba-\nsin\u2019s economy. \nThe Uinta Basin Railway could unlock the basin\u2019s \npotential. By building 88 miles of railroad track from \nthe heart of the basin to a new connection with the \nnational rail network, the project would bridge the \ntransportation gap that stops farmers, ranchers, man-\nufacturers, and oil producers from selling to wider \nmarkets. This railway would carry diverse commodi-\nties, improving lives by boosting the basin\u2019s economy. \nBut its initial success depends on its ability to \ntransport the basin\u2019s environmentally superior waxy \ncrude oil to refineries in other parts of the country. \n\n \n \n10\nOf course, success is not guaranteed. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway is an economic development project spon-\nsored by a unit of state government, Petitioner Seven \nCounty Infrastructure Coalition. To facilitate the Sur-\nface Transportation Board\u2019s environmental review of \nits project, Seven County made high and low esti-\nmates of the oil production that the project could sup-\nport, and thus the number of trains that might travel \non the new rail line. It also told the Board about refin-\neries around the country where that oil could be deliv-\nered, displacing oil from other sources. But Seven \nCounty did not have contracts with any of those down-\nstream refineries or with any upstream oil developers. \nSo it had no way of knowing which shippers would use \nthe new rail line, much less where the oil would go. \nC. Administrative and Judicial Proceedings \nThe Surface Transportation Board started its envi-\nronmental review of the Uinta Basin Railway in June \n2019. After more than a year of study, the Board pub-\nlished a draft environmental impact statement de-\nscribing the environmental effects of three alternative \nrail alignments. The Board then revised that draft \nbased on public and agency input, leading to a 3,600-\npage final statement in August 2021\u2014more than two \nyears after the review began. \nThe Board\u2019s environmental review confirmed the \nseparateness of any oil development. New oil wells \nwould involve \u201cprojects that have not yet been pro-\nposed or planned,\u201d and which could occur on private, \nstate, tribal, or federal land, where they would be \nstudied and regulated by the appropriate agencies. \nJA1238. The Board similarly found that \u201cit is not pos-\nsible to identify specific refineries\u201d\u2014also separately \nregulated\u2014\u201cthat would receive shipments\u201d of oil from \nthe Uinta Basin. Pet.App.111a. Some of those \n\n \n \n11\nrefineries could be in Louisiana; others could be in \nTexas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, or Washington. JA1189. \nAs for the effects of transporting Uinta Basin oil after \nit leaves the new 88-mile rail line, the Board found \nthat the Uinta Basin Railway would connect with Un-\nion Pacific\u2019s line. Pet.App.77a. Safety on those lines is \nregulated by the Federal Railroad Administration, not \nthe Board. See 49 C.F.R. Parts 200\u2013299 (FRA safety \nrules). \nWhile the Board prepared its environmental re-\nview, Petitioner Seven County sought an exemption \nfrom the Board\u2019s usual regulatory requirements for \nnew rail construction. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502 (describ-\ning the exemption process). Since the environmental \nreview had by then been underway for nearly a year, \nSeven County also asked the Board to preliminarily \naddress the transportation merits o\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004), this Court held that when \nan agency cannot prevent an environmental effect \n\u201cdue to its limited statutory authority over the rele-\nvant actions,\u201d the National Environmental Policy Act \ndoes not require it to study that effect. This holding \nhas divided the courts of appeals. Five circuits read \nPublic Citizen to mean that an agency\u2019s environmen-\ntal review can stop where its regulatory authority \nstops. Two circuits disagree and require review of any \nimpact that can be called reasonably foreseeable. \nHere, the Surface Transportation Board relied on \nPublic Citizen to cabin its environmental review of a \nnew rail line in Utah. But the D.C. Circuit rejected \nthat approach, ruling that the Board \u201ccannot avoid\u201d \nenvironmental review \u201con the ground that it lacks au-\nthority to prevent, control, or mitigate\u201d distant envi-\nronmental effects. As a result, it ordered the Board to \nstudy the local effects of oil wells and refineries that \nlie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory authority. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the National Environmental Policy Act  \nrequires an agency to study environmental impacts  \nbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which \nthe agency has regulatory authority. \n \n \n\n \n \nii\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING  \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nThis petition seeks review of two cases that were \nconsolidated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In \nthis Court, Petitioners are the Seven County Infra-\nstructure Coalition and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC. \nRespondents in this Court who were petitioners in the \ncourt of appeals are Eagle County, Colorado, the Cen-\nter for Biological Diversity, Living Rivers, Sierra \nClub, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, \nand WildEarth Guardians. Respondents in this Court \nwho were respondents in the court of appeals are the \nSurface Transportation Board, the United States of \nAmerica, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \nPetitioner Seven County Infrastructure Coalition is \nan independent political subdivision of the State of \nUtah. Its member counties are Carbon, Daggett, \nDuchesne, Emery, San Juan, Sevier, and Uintah. It \nhas no parent corporation, nor does it issue shares \nheld by any publicly traded company. \nPetitioner Uinta Basin Railway, LLC is a limited \nliability company organized and existing in the state \nof Delaware. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uinta \nBasin Railway Holdings, LLC, which is an affiliate of \nDHIP Group, LP. Neither Uinta Basin Railway Hold-\nings, LLC nor DHIP Group, LP issues securities to the \npublic, and no publicly held company has a 10% or \ngreater ownership interest in either Uinta Basin Rail-\nway Holdings, LLC or DHIP Group, LP. \n \n \n\n \n \niii\nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises from the following proceedings: \n\uf0b7 Eagle County, Colorado v.

This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C) (2019) provides: \nThe Congress authorizes and directs that, to the \nfullest extent possible: (1) the policies, regulations, \nand public laws of the United States shall be inter-\npreted and administered in accordance with the poli-\ncies set forth in this chapter, and (2) all agencies of the \nFederal Government shall\u2014 \n(C) include in every recommendation or report on \nproposals for legislation and other major Federal ac-\ntions significantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment, a detailed statement by the responsible \nofficial on\u2014 \n\n \n \n2\n(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, \n(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot \nbe avoided should the proposal be implemented, \n(iii) alternatives to the proposed action, \n(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses \nof man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and en-\nhancement of long-term productivity, and \n(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments \nof resources which would be involved in the proposed \naction should it be implemented. \nPrior to making any detailed statement, the re-\nsponsible Federal official shall consult with and ob-\ntain the comments of any Federal agency which has \njurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to \nany environmental impact involved. Copies of such \nstatement and the comments and views of appropriate \nFederal, State, and local agencies, which are author-\nized to develop and enforce environmental standards, \nshall be made available to the President, the Council \non Environmental Quality and to the public as pro-\nvided in section 552 of title 5, and shall accompany the \nproposal through the existing agency review pro-\ncesses[.] \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8 (2019) provides: \nEffects include: \n(a) Direct effects, which are caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place. \n(b) Indirect effects, which are caused by the action \nand are later in time or farther removed in distance, \nbut are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects \nmay include growth inducing effects and other effects \nrelated to induced changes in the pattern of land use, \n\n \n \n3\npopulation density or growth rate, and related effects \non air and water and other natural systems, including \necosystems. \nEffects and impacts as used in these regulations \nare synonymous. Effects include ecological (such as \nthe effects on natural resources and on the compo-\nnents, structures, and functioning of affected ecosys-\ntems) aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or \nhealth, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative). Ef-\nfects may also include those resulting from actions \nwhich may have both beneficial and detrimental ef-\nfects, even if on balance the agency believes that the \neffect will be beneficial. \n \n \n\n \n \n4\nINTRODUCTION \nThis case presents a circuit split over the meaning \nof Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752 (2004). That decision held that \u201cwhere an \nagency has no ability to prevent\u201d an environmental ef-\nfect \u201cdue to its limited statutory authority over the rel-\nevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a le-\ngally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d Id. at 770. Hence, \nthe agency need not study that effect in its National \nEnvironmental Policy Act review. Id. \nMost circuits see Public Citizen as tying the scope \nof an agency\u2019s NEPA review to the limits of that \nagency\u2019s regulatory authority. As the Sixth Circuit \nput it, \u201cagencies may reasonably limit their NEPA re-\nview to only those effects proximately caused by the \nactions over which they have regulatory responsibil-\nity.\u201d Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng\u2019rs, 746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014). \nThus, the \u201cline between those causal changes that \nmay make an actor responsible for an effect and those \nthat do not\u201d will \u201capproximate the limits of an \nagency\u2019s area of control.\u201d N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Protection \nv. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 (3d \nCir. 2009). In other words, an \u201cagency is on the hook\u201d \nunder Public Citizen \u201conly for the decisions that it has \nthe authority to make.\u201d Protect Our Parks v. Buttigieg, \n39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022). \nBut the D.C. Circuit takes a conflicting view. It \nreads Public Citizen as turning \u201cnot on the question \n\u2018What activities does [the agency] regulate,\u2019\u201d but on \nthe agency\u2019s power to block a project that \u201cwould be \ntoo harmful to the environment.\u201d Sierra Club v. FERC \n(Sabal Trail), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nOn this view, agencies must consider even those dis-\ntant environmental effects that are another agency\u2019s \n\n \n \n5\nresponsibility: \u201c[T]he existence of permit require-\nments overseen by another federal agency or state \npermitting authority cannot substitute for a proper \nNEPA analysis.\u201d Id. at 1375. \nThe Eleventh Circuit has expressly rejected the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201coutlier\u201d view, criticizing its sister cir-\ncuit for \u201cfailing to take seriously the rule in Public Cit-\nizen\u201d and ignoring \u201cthe untenable consequences of its \ndecision.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1299\u20131300 (11th Cir. \n2019). Like the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits, the Eleventh Circuit holds that when an agency \n\u201clacks the authority to regulate\u201d an effect \u201cwholesale,\u201d \nPublic Citizen does not require the agency to consider \nthat effect. Id. at 1294. The Eleventh Circuit also re-\njected the D.C. Circuit\u2019s NEPA-based dismissal of \nother agencies\u2019 oversight, holding instead that an en-\nvironmental review may exclude \u201cdistantly caused ef-\nfects\u201d that are subject to \u201cindependent regulatory \nschemes.\u201d Id. at 1292. \nThe decision here shows why the D.C. Circuit is on \nthe wrong side of this conflict. Petitioners want to \nbuild a new 88-mile common carrier rail line that \nwould link an isolated part of Utah to the national rail \nnetwork. They sought and received the Surface Trans-\nportation Board\u2019s approval to do so. But when oppo-\nnents of Petitioners\u2019 project challenged it in the D.C. \nCircuit, they said nothing about the proximate effects \nof the 88-mile line that the Board had approved. In-\nstead, they argued that the Board should have done \nmore to study the distant effects of the main commod-\nity that the rail line would carry\u2014waxy crude oil. \nIn approving the rail line, the Board had explained \nthat it lacked \u201cauthority or jurisdiction over develop-\nment of oil and gas\u201d and could not \u201ccontrol or mitigate \n\n \n \n6\nthe impacts of any such development.\u201d Pet.App.108a. \nThus, the Board reasoned, those impacts were not in-\ndirect effects of the rail line under Public Citizen. \nPet.App.108a. The D.C. Circuit held otherwise: \u201cThe \nBoard [] cannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA \nto identify and describe the environmental effects of \nincreased oil drilling and refining on the ground that \nit lacks authority to prevent, control, or mitigate those \ndevelopments.\u201d Pet.App.36a. Under this rule, the \nBoard had to consider not only the effects of the new \nrail line it was permitting in Utah, but also the hypo-\nthetical, localized effects of processing the oil carried \non the line at separately regulated Gulf Coast refiner-\nies a thousand miles away. Pet.App.36a\u201337a. \nBy requiring an agency to consider any environ-\nmental effect that it has the power to prevent, no mat-\nter the limits of its regulatory authority, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s rule turns each agency into a \u201cde facto environ-\nmental-policy czar.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 941 \nF.3d at 1299. To avoid that outcome, the last admin-\nistration adopted new NEPA rules that relied on Pub-\nlic Citizen to limit the scope of agency environmental \nreview. See 85 Fed. Reg. 43304, 43344 (July 16, 2020). \nBut just two years later, a new administration re-\nversed course, abandoned the majority reading of \nPublic Citizen, and reinstated the old NEPA rules. See \n87 Fed. Reg. 23453, 23464 (Apr. 20, 2022). These du-\neling White House interpretations of Public Citizen \nunderscore the reasons for review here. Agencies need \na manageable line to guide their NEPA studies, and \nthis Court is now the only place to find one. \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe National Environmental Policy Act makes \u201ca \nbroad national commitment to protecting and promot-\ning environmental quality.\u201d Robertson v. Methow Val-\nley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989). To ful-\nfill that commitment, NEPA requires agencies to pre-\npare a report that \u201ctake[s] a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the environ-\nmental consequences\u201d of their actions. Baltimore Gas \n& Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, 97 \n(1983). But \u201cNEPA itself does not mandate particular \nresults,\u201d only \u201cthe necessary process\u201d for considering \nthe environmental effects of agency action. Robertson, \n490 U.S. at 350. Because this environmental review \nprocess can become an end in itself, the Court from \ntime-to-time has had to step in to draw \u201c[c]ommon \nsense\u201d boundaries. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power \nCorp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 \n(1978). This case should be another one of those times. \nA. Legal Background \nPublic Citizen illustrates how this Court has im-\nposed common sense on the NEPA process. The \nCourt\u2019s decision started by emphasizing that NEPA\u2019s \n\u201cprocedural requirements\u201d have \u201ca particular focus on \nrequiring agencies to undertake analyses of the envi-\nronmental impact of their proposals and actions.\u201d 541 \nU.S. at 756\u201357. The Court then turned to the facts be-\nfore it, which involved the President\u2019s decision to lift \na longstanding moratorium on Mexican motor carriers \noperating in the United States. Id. 759. Before that \ndecision could take effect, the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration had to promulgate new safety \nrules for the Mexican carriers. Id. at 760. But that was \nall FMCSA could do. It had \u201cno statutory authority to \nimpose or enforce emissions controls or to establish \n\n \n \n8\nenvironmental requirements unrelated to motor car-\nrier safety.\u201d Id. at 759. \nBecause FMCSA\u2019s role was limited to enforcing mo-\ntor carrier safety, its NEPA review \u201cdid not consider \nany environmental impact that might be caused by \nthe increased presence of Mexican trucks within the \nUnited States.\u201d Id. at 761. Yet when FMCSA\u2019s safety \nrules were challenged, the court of appeals found that \nthe agency\u2019s NEPA review had \u201cfailed to give ade-\nquate consideration to the overall environmental im-\npact of lifting the moratorium\u201d on Mexican trucks. Id. \nat 762. \nThis Court unanimously reversed. In so doing, the \nCourt recognized that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for \nMexican trucks to operate in the United States until \nFMCSA issued its rules. Id. at 765. Still, it found that \nthose rules were not the \u201ccause\u201d of the trucks\u2019 overall \nimpact. Id. at 765\u201367. The Court based this finding on \nthe principle that \u201cNEPA requires \u2018a reasonably close \ncausal relationship\u2019 between the environmental effect \nand the alleged cause.\u201d Id. at 767 (quoting Metro. Ed-\nison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983)). \u201cBut for\u201d causation was not enough. \nId. And since FMCSA lacked the \u201cability categorically \nto prevent\u201d trucks from entering the country, it did not \ncause the environmental effects of those trucks\u2019 \n\u201ccross-border operations.\u201d Id. at 768. The Court sum-\nmarized its holding this way: \u201c[W]here an agency has \nno ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited \nstatutory authority over the relevant actions, the \nagency cannot be considered the legally relevant \n\u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d Id. at 770. \n\n \n \n9\nB. Factual Background \nPublic Citizen was central to the Surface Transpor-\ntation Board\u2019s decision to authorize construction and \noperation of the new rail line here\u2014the Uinta Basin \nRailway. That railway will serve the Uinta Basin, a \n12,000-square-mile area in northeast Utah and north-\nwest Colorado that is isolated by the mountain ranges \nand plateaus of the western Rockies. Though the ba-\nsin is about the same size as Maryland, the only way \nto reach it today is over two-lane roads that cross high \nmountain passes. This inaccessibility makes it hard \nfor people living in the basin to participate in the \nbroader economy. \nIf the basin were less isolated, it would change peo-\nple\u2019s lives. The basin is filled with untapped natural \nresources, including valuable minerals, natural gas, \nand waxy crude oil. The basin\u2019s farmers and ranchers \ngrow alfalfa, corn, and cattle. But without better in-\nfrastructure, these products can never reach the rest \nof the country. At the same time, products from the \nrest of the country cannot easily reach the people liv-\ning in the basin. These chokepoints raise costs for eve-\nryone, blocking diverse trade and throttling the ba-\nsin\u2019s economy. \nThe Uinta Basin Railway could unlock the basin\u2019s \npotential. By building 88 miles of railroad track from \nthe heart of the basin to a new connection with the \nnational rail network, the project would bridge the \ntransportation gap that stops farmers, ranchers, man-\nufacturers, and oil producers from selling to wider \nmarkets. This railway would carry diverse commodi-\nties, improving lives by boosting the basin\u2019s economy. \nBut its initial success depends on its ability to \ntransport the basin\u2019s environmentally superior waxy \ncrude oil to refineries in other parts of the country. \n\n \n \n10\nOf course, success is not guaranteed. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway is an economic development project spon-\nsored by a unit of state government, Petitioner Seven \nCounty Infrastructure Coalition. To facilitate the Sur-\nface Transportation Board\u2019s environmental review of \nits project, Seven County made high and low esti-\nmates of the oil production that the project could sup-\nport, and thus the number of trains that might travel \non the new rail line. It also told the Board about refin-\neries around the country where that oil could be deliv-\nered, displacing oil from other sources. But Seven \nCounty did not have contracts with any of those down-\nstream refineries or with any upstream oil developers. \nSo it had no way of knowing which shippers would use \nthe new rail line, much less where the oil would go. \nC. Administrative and Judicial Proceedings \nThe Surface Transportation Board started its envi-\nronmental review of the Uinta Basin Railway in June \n2019. After more than a year of study, the Board pub-\nlished a draft environmental impact statement de-\nscribing the environmental effects of three alternative \nrail alignments. The Board then revised that draft \nbased on public and agency input, leading to a 3,600-\npage final statement in August 2021\u2014more than two \nyears after the review began. \nThe Board\u2019s environmental review confirmed the \nseparateness of any oil development. New oil wells \nwould involve \u201cprojects that have not yet been pro-\nposed or planned,\u201d and which could occur on private, \nstate, tribal, or federal land, where they would be \nstudied and regulated by the appropriate agencies. \nJA1238. The Board similarly found that \u201cit is not pos-\nsible to identify specific refineries\u201d\u2014also separately \nregulated\u2014\u201cthat would receive shipments\u201d of oil from \nthe Uinta Basin. Pet.App.111a. Some of those \n\n \n \n11\nrefineries could be in Louisiana; others could be in \nTexas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, or Washington. JA1189. \nAs for the effects of transporting Uinta Basin oil after \nit leaves the new 88-mile rail line, the Board found \nthat the Uinta Basin Railway would connect with Un-\nion Pacific\u2019s line. Pet.App.77a. Safety on those lines is \nregulated by the Federal Railroad Administration, not \nthe Board. See 49 C.F.R. Parts 200\u2013299 (FRA safety \nrules). \nWhile the Board prepared its environmental re-\nview, Petitioner Seven County sought an exemption \nfrom the Board\u2019s usual regulatory requirements for \nnew rail construction. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502 (describ-\ning the exemption process). Since the environmental \nreview had by then been underway for nearly a year, \nSeven County also asked the Board to preliminarily \naddress the transportation merits of the new rail line. \nIn January 2021, the Board agreed that the Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway qualified for an exemption, subject to \ncompletion of the still-ongoing environmental review. \nPet.App.206a\u2013210a. \nOnce the environmental review was done, the \nBoard made a final decision approving the project. \nThe bulk of that decision was devoted to an analysis \nof the new rail line\u2019s environmental effects. As part of \nthat analysis, the Board explained that under Public \nCitizen, \u201cwhen an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a \ncertain effect due to its limited statutory authority \nover the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered the legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect\u2019 for \nNEPA purposes.\u201d Pet.App.107a\u2013108a (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767\u201368). Because the Board had \n\u201cno authority or jurisdiction over development of oil \nand gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development,\u201d it \n\n \n \n12\nconcluded that the effects of oil and gas development \nwere not indirect effects of the new rail line. \nPet.App.108a. Similarly, because the Board lacked \npower to \u201cregulate or mitigate impacts caused by\u201d \nother rail carriers\u2019 operations in other states, it de-\nclined to treat those carriers\u2019 operations as indirect ef-\nfects of the new rail line in the Uinta Basin. \nPet.App.112a. \nHaving concluded that its environmental review \nmet NEPA\u2019s requirements under Public Citizen and \notherwise, the Board approved construction and oper-\nation of the new rail line. Pet.App.122a. Board Chair-\nman Oberman dissented. Pet.App.123a\u2013147a. \nRespondents\u2014Eagle County, Colorado and a collec-\ntion of environmental groups led by the Center for Bi-\nological Diversity\u2014separately petitioned for review of \nthe Board\u2019s decision in the D.C. Circuit, which had ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2342(5) and 2321(a). Pe-\ntitioners Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and \nproposed rail line operator Uinta Basin Railway, LLC \nintervened in both cases to defend the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion. Since the two petitions raised some of the same \nissues, the court consolidated them. After briefing and \nargument, the court vacated and remanded the \nBoard\u2019s decision. \nThe D.C. Circuit recognized that the Board had re-\nlied on Public Citizen to set the scope of its environ-\nmental review. Pet.App.36a. But the court rejected \nthe Board\u2019s reading of that case. It explained that the \nBoard \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of in-\ncreased oil drilling and refining on the ground that it \nlacks authority to prevent, control, or mitigate those \ndevelopments.\u201d Pet.App.36a. To the contrary, the \ncourt held, the Board\u2019s mere \u201cauthority to deny\u201d a new \n\n \n \n13\nrail project \u201con the ground that the railway\u2019s antici-\npated environmental and other costs outweigh its ex-\npected benefits\u201d meant that \u201cthe Board\u2019s argument \nthat it need not consider effects it cannot prevent is \nsimply inapplicable.\u201d Pet.App.36a\u201337a (citing Sabal \nTrail, 867 F.3d at 1373). \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision also found inadequate \nthe Board\u2019s review under the Endangered Species Act \nand its analysis under the ICC Termination Act. And \nit affirmed some aspects of the Board\u2019s environmental \nreview. None of those holdings is at issue here. The \ncourt of appeals remanded this case to the Board \u201cfor \nfurther proceedings,\u201d Pet.App.71a, and the Board \nmust prepare a new NEPA document before it can ad-\ndress any other issue.  \nPetitioners timely sought en banc rehearing of the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s decision. The court denied their petition \non December 4, 2023. Pet.App.72a\u201373a. \n \n \n\n \n \n14\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nFaced with NEPA\u2019s general requirement to report \non the environmental effects of major federal actions, \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C), agencies need a \u201cmanageable line \nbetween those causal changes that may make an actor \nresponsible for an effect and those that do not.\u201d Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 n.7). This Court tried to draw such a line \nin Public Citizen when it held that an agency\u2019s \u201clim-\nited statutory authority\u201d over an action could break \nthe causal chain. Most circuits have embraced this \nline. But the two circuits that handle the most NEPA \ncases\u2014the D.C. Circuit and the Ninth Circuit\u2014have \nnot. This case squarely presents the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nparsimonious reading of Public Citizen, which the \nEleventh Circuit has expressly rejected, and which \nfour other circuits reject in principle. By hearing the \ncase, the Court can make sure that the line it drew in \nPublic Citizen stays manageable. \nI. The circuits are split over what Public  \nCitizen\u2019s \u201climited statutory authority\u201d  \nholding means. \nA. Five circuits hold that agencies need not \nstudy environmental effects that they do \nnot regulate. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Center for Bio-\nlogical Diversity dives deepest into the meaning of \nPublic Citizen. In that case, the Corps of Engineers \nwas permitting wetland discharges required for the \nexpansion of a phosphate mine in Florida. Ctr. for Bi-\nological Diversity, 941 F.3d at 1292. The Corps\u2019 NEPA \nreview addressed the direct and indirect effects of \nthose discharges. Id. at 1293. But the Corps did not \nstudy the effects of refining the phosphate ore into \n\n \n \n15\nfertilizer or the effects of storing a radioactive refining \nbyproduct called phosphogypsum\u2014even though the \nprocessing and waste storage would be done by the \nsame company in the same state. Id. at 1293\u201394. \nRelying on Public Citizen, the Eleventh Circuit up-\nheld the Corps\u2019 focused environmental review. The \ncourt began by pointing out that \u201c[t]he Corps did not \nissue a mining permit, nor a permit to produce ferti-\nlizer or store phosphogypsum\u2014it has no jurisdiction \nto regulate or authorize any of that.\u201d Id. at 1294. It \nwent on to note that \u201cEPA and the [Florida Depart-\nment of Environmental Protection]\u2014not the Corps\u2014\ndirectly regulate fertilizer plants and phosphogyp-\nsum.\u201d Id. at 1295. \u201c[I]t was sensible,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, \u201cfor the Corps to draw the line at the reaches \nof its own jurisdiction, leaving the effects of phos-\nphogypsum to phosphogypsum\u2019s regulators\u201d and \u201cre-\nspecting the jurisdictional boundaries set by Congress \nand inherent in state-federal cooperation.\u201d Id. at \n1295\u201396. Any other reading of Public Citizen would \nturn the Corps into a \u201cde facto environmental-policy \nczar\u201d that could deny a permit based on \u201cits dislike of \nthe applicant\u2019s business or downstream effects not \nsufficiently caused by\u201d the activity the Corps was per-\nmitting. Id. at 1296, 1299. \nThe Sixth Circuit has likewise read Public Citizen \nas limiting an agency\u2019s environmental review obliga-\ntions to actions over which the agency has regulatory \nauthority. Kentuckians, 746 F.3d at 706, 708\u201310. That \ncase involved a coal mine that was permitted by the \nstate, but which also required a permit from the Corps \nof Engineers. Id. at 701\u201302. Despite public comments \nurging it to weigh the significant health effects of min-\ning, the Corps concluded that its permit to fill streams \n\n \n \n16\nwith spoil from the mine\u2014once mitigated\u2014would not \nsignificantly affect the environment. Id. at 704 & n.1. \nThe Sixth Circuit agreed with the Corps\u2019 decision \nnot to study the broader effects of the mine. Citing \nPublic Citizen, it held that \u201cin the context of a com-\nplete regulatory scheme, agencies may reasonably \nlimit their NEPA review to only those effects proxi-\nmately caused by the actions over which they have \nregulatory responsibility.\u201d Id. at 710. The \u201ccomplete \nregulatory scheme\u201d at issue in Kentuckians was the \nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which \nallowed states that met federal minimum standards \nto regulate coal mining. Id. at 701\u201302. And as the \ncourt pointed out, \u201c[t]here are good reasons\u201d for Con-\ngress to avoid \u201ca regulatory system in which each reg-\nulatory actor involved in a large operation, even in a \ncomparatively minor way, is required to consider all \nof the effects of the overall project.\u201d Id. at 709. \nBoth the Eleventh and the Sixth Circuits\u2019 decisions \ndrew on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Ohio Valley \nCoalition v. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. \n2009). Ohio Valley also involved a Corps of Engineers \npermit issued in connection with a state-permitted \ncoal mine. Id. at 189\u201391. But the mine opponents\u2019 ar-\ngument in Ohio Valley was narrower. They asked only \nthat the Corps consider the effects of spoil disposal \noutside jurisdictional waters, not that it study the en-\ntire mine. Id. 188, 193. Still, the court of appeals ruled \nagainst them. Noting that \u201cthe Corps has no legal au-\nthority to prevent the placement of fill material in ar-\neas outside of the waters of the United States,\u201d the \ncourt held that under Public Citizen, the Corps did not \nhave to study effects over which it lacked \u201ccontrol and \nresponsibility.\u201d Id. at 196\u201397. And, like the Eleventh \nand Sixth Circuits, the Fourth Circuit pointed out \n\n \n \n17\nthat any other NEPA rule would render the state\u2019s \nregulatory scheme \u201cat best duplicative, and, at worst, \nmeaningless.\u201d Id. at 196. \nThe Corps of Engineers is far from the only agency \nto have faced these issues. In a Third Circuit case, pro-\nject opponents questioned the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission\u2019s decision not to study the potential ef-\nfects of an airborne terrorist attack on a New Jersey \nnuclear power plant. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Protection, \n561 F.3d at 135. The court of appeals responded by \nlooking to Public Citizen. Following this Court\u2019s direc-\ntion to \u201cdraw a manageable line\u201d to assess causation, \nthe Third Circuit concluded that \u201cthis line appears to \napproximate the limits of an agency\u2019s area of control.\u201d \nId. at 139. Because the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-\nsion had \u201cno authority over the airspace above its fa-\ncilities,\u201d it did not have to study the potential environ-\nmental effects of an airplane crashing into a nuclear \npower plant. Id. \nFinally and most recently, the Seventh Circuit re-\nlied on Public Citizen in rejecting a NEPA challenge \nto the Obama Presidential Center. It explained that \nNEPA \u201cdoes not require agencies to waste time and \nresources evaluating environmental effects that those \nagencies neither caused nor have the authority to \nchange.\u201d Protect Our Parks, 39 F.4th at 393. And \nwhile building the center at the preferred site re-\nquired National Park Service approval, the Service \nlacked control over the site-selection process. Id. 399. \nBecause Public Citizen put the Service \u201con the hook \nonly for the decisions that it has the authority to \nmake,\u201d the Service could \u201cconfine\u201d its NEPA analysis \n\u201cto the portions of the project that are subject to fed-\neral review.\u201d Id. at 399\u2013400. \n\n \n \n18\nB. Two Circuits require agencies to review \neffects they do not regulate, despite  \nPublic Citizen. \nThe D.C. Circuit takes a starkly different view of \nPublic Citizen. That view emerged in the court\u2019s Sabal \nTrail decision, which held that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission\u2019s environmental review of a \nnatural gas pipeline should have considered the ef-\nfects of burning the gas in power plants. 867 F.3d at \n1371\u201372. To reach that holding, the court limited Pub-\nlic Citizen to cases in which an agency was barred \nfrom even considering the relevant environmental ef-\nfects when making its decision. See id. at 1373. By \nnarrowing Public Citizen, the D.C. Circuit expanded \nagencies\u2019 environmental review duties to cover any ef-\nfect \u201csufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordi-\nnary prudence would take it into account in reaching \na decision.\u201d Id. at 1371 (brackets omitted). In this way, \nthe D.C. Circuit dropped Public Citizen\u2019s focus on an \nagency\u2019s regulatory authority in favor of an agency\u2019s \ncapacity to speculate about foreseeable effects. \nThe D.C. Circuit in Sabal Trail seemed to know \nthat it was departing from other circuits\u2019 reading of \nPublic Citizen. Without citing those other circuits\u2019 de-\ncisions, Sabal Trail expressly rejected the idea that \nPublic Citizen turned \u201con the question \u2018What activities \ndoes FERC regulate?\u2019\u201d (id. at 1373)\u2014exactly the idea \nthat the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Circuits had already \nendorsed. The D.C. Circuit also held that \u201cthe exist-\nence of permit requirements overseen by another fed-\neral agency or state permitting authority cannot sub-\nstitute for a proper NEPA analysis.\u201d Id. at 1375. \nAgain, the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Circuits had held \nthe opposite. \n\n \n \n19\nThe Eleventh Circuit saw this conflict. And while it \npointed out some superficial factual differences be-\ntween Sabal Trail and the situation it was facing in \nCenter for Biological Diversity, it emphasized that \n\u201cthe legal analysis in Sabal Trail is questionable at \nbest.\u201d 941 F.3d at 1300. That analysis, the Eleventh \nCircuit said, \u201cfails to take seriously the rule of reason \nannounced in Public Citizen or to account for the un-\ntenable consequences of [the court\u2019s] decision.\u201d Id. \nThe Ninth Circuit, unlike the Eleventh, has relied \non Sabal Trail\u2019s analysis. In Center for Biological Di-\nversity v. Bernhardt, the Ninth Circuit repeatedly \ncited Sabal Trail in holding that the Bureau of Ocean \nEnergy Management should have estimated emis-\nsions from foreign oil consumption when preparing its \nNEPA review for an offshore oil drilling and produc-\ntion facility. 982 F.3d 723, 731, 736\u201340 (9th Cir. 2020). \nLike the D.C. Circuit in Sabal Trail, the Ninth Circuit \nreached this conclusion despite the Bureau\u2019s inability \nto regulate\u2014or even estimate the change in\u2014foreign \nnations\u2019 oil consumption. Id. at 738. Public Citizen, \nmeanwhile, appears only as a \u201ccf.\u201d cite after the penul-\ntimate sentence in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis. \nThat leaves the court of appeals in this case. The \nSurface Transportation Board here approved an 88-\nmile rail line that links the Uinta Basin with the na-\ntional rail network. That new rail line would carry \ncrude oil, but the Board reasoned that Public Citizen \ndid not require it to study the distant effects of the oil\u2019s \nextraction, transportation on other rail lines, or re-\nfinement\u2014effects over which it had \u201cno authority or \njurisdiction.\u201d Pet.App.108a. The D.C. Circuit, citing \nSabal Trail, called the Board\u2019s logic \u201csimply inappli-\ncable.\u201d Pet.App.37a. In the court of appeals\u2019 view, the \nBoard\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority to prevent, control, or \n\n \n \n20\nmitigate\u201d distant effects did not \u201cexcuse[]\u201d it from \nstudying them under NEPA. Pet.App.36a\u201337a. \nFinally, it does not matter that the \u201cpublic conven-\nience and necessity\u201d permitting standard that applied \nhere and in Sabal Trail differs from the Corps of En-\ngineers\u2019 permitting standard. NEPA addresses the en-\nvironmental effects of agency actions, not the agency\u2019s \npermitting standard. In any case, as the Sixth Circuit \nnoted in Kentuckians, the Corps\u2019 rules require \u201ca pub-\nlic interest review for all permit decisions.\u201d 746 F.3d \nat 712 (citing 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4(a)). Such a public in-\nterest review gave the Corps just as much power to \ndeny the permits in Center for Biological Diversity, \nKentuckians, and Ohio Valley as FERC had in Sabal \nTrail or the Surface Transportation Board had here. \nThus, the agencies\u2019 substantive decision-making rules \ncannot account for the circuits\u2019 conflicting interpreta-\ntions of Public Citizen. \n* \n* \n* \nThe sharp split between the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reading \nof Public Citizen and the reading employed by the \nThird, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \nis ready for this Court to resolve. As a legal matter, \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cfails to take seriously\u201d \nthe logic of Public Citizen. Ctr. for Biological Diversity, \n941 F.3d at 1300. As a practical matter, the two ap-\nproaches cannot be reconciled. It makes no sense that \na Corps permit essential to a coal mine does not trig-\nger a study of the mine\u2019s effects, while a rail line that \nmerely carries crude oil requires a study of oil extrac-\ntion and refinement. Compare Kentuckians, 746 F.3d \nat 708\u201310 with Pet.App.36a\u201337a. And the 5\u20132 split \namong the circuits (with the Ninth Circuit mimicking \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach) is deep enough to warrant \nthis Court\u2019s immediate attention. \n\n \n \n21\nII. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s cramped reading of  \nPublic Citizen is not just wrong; it turns \nagencies into environmental-policy czars. \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach to Public Citizen not \nonly diverges from the path followed by five other cir-\ncuits, it undercuts Public Citizen itself. \nIn Public Citizen, the Court saw that the argument \nfor broadly scoped NEPA review rested \u201con a particu-\nlarly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority \nto prevent the effect.\u201d 541 U.S. at 767. The key ques-\ntion here is what the Court meant by \u201cno authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d The answer hinges on the Court\u2019s \nobservation that it was \u201cimpossible for any Mexican \nmotor carrier to receive authorization to operate \nwithin the United States until FMCSA issued\u201d its new \nrules. Id. at 765. In that sense, the agency did have \nthe \u201cauthority\u201d\u2014i.e., the raw power\u2014\u201cto prevent\u201d \nMexican trucks from entering the country. What it \nlacked was any regulatory authority over the effects of \nthose trucks\u2019 entry. So when the Court said that \nFMCSA had \u201cno authority to prevent the effect[s]\u201d of \nMexican trucks entering the country, it was talking \nabout the agency\u2019s lack of regulatory authority. \nThe D.C. Circuit \u201cbreez[es] past\u201d this Court\u2019s rea-\nsoning, as the Eleventh Circuit has pointed out, focus-\ning instead on the \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d of dis-\ntant effects, \u201cas understood colloquially.\u201d Ctr. for Bio-\nlogical Diversity, 941 F.3d at 1300. This misguided fo-\ncus is clear in Sabal Trail. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis \nin that case started from the premise that \u201c[t]he \nphrase \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 is the key here.\u201d Sabal \nTrail, 867 F.3d at 1371. The court then required a re-\nview of distant environmental effects that are \n\n \n \n22\nregulated by other agencies because they were reason-\nably foreseeable. Id. at 1372. Only after finding the \neffects reasonably foreseeable did the court in Sabal \nTrail confront Public Citizen. That analysis is back-\nwards. Instead of first considering the scope of the \nagency\u2019s regulatory authority, Sabal Trail simply \nasked whether the agency had \u201clegal power to pre-\nvent\u201d an effect. Id. (emphasis omitted). Because that \nquestion goes to \u201cbut for\u201d causation, not regulatory au-\nthority, it misses Public Citizen\u2019s point. \nThe court of appeals made the same mistake here. \nExpressly relying on Sabal Trail, the court focused on \nreasonable foreseeability, ultimately concluding that \nthe Surface Transportation Board should have \u201cen-\ngage[d] in \u2018reasonable forecasting and speculation\u2019\u201d to \n\u201cquantify the environmental effects\u201d of oil wells lo-\ncated somewhere in the 12,000-square mile Uinta Ba-\nsin. Pet.App.32a, 34a. Similarly, the court held that \nthe Board should have \u201cestimate[d] the emissions or \nother environmental impacts\u201d of refining oil a thou-\nsand miles away from the new rail line\u2019s endpoint. \nPet.App.34a. As in Sabal Trail, the court waited to ad-\ndress Public Citizen, then rejected the Board\u2019s use of \nthat decision as an effort to \u201cavoid its responsibility \nunder NEPA . . . on the ground that it lacks authority \nto prevent, control, or mitigate\u201d distant environmen-\ntal effects. Pet.App.36a. This approach effectively con-\nfines Public Citizen to its facts and requires agencies \nto study any environmental effect that their decisions \ncan \u201cprevent.\u201d Pet.App.37a. Such repackaging of the \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation analysis that Public Citizen re-\njected cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s ruling. \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s cramped reading of Public Citi-\nzen has another, bigger problem that the Eleventh \nCircuit also flagged. If NEPA required agencies to \n\n \n \n23\nassess distant effects over which they have no regula-\ntory responsibility, it would turn those agencies into \n\u201cenvironmental-policy czar[s].\u201d Ctr. for Biological Di-\nversity, 941 F.3d at 1299. Such czars, rather than fo-\ncusing on the effects of their own actions, could deny \npermits based on issues that lie outside both their au-\nthority and their expertise. See id. And that is just \nwhat the D.C. Circuit asked the agency here to do. \nThe court of appeals was right that the Surface \nTransportation Board had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over \nthe construction and operation of\u201d the Uinta Basin \nRailway, and that the Board could decline the project \n\u201cif the environmental harm caused by the railway out-\nweigh[ed] its transportation benefits.\u201d Pet.App.36a. \nBut it did not follow that the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis \nhad to cover all \u201creasonably foreseeable environmen-\ntal harms\u201d\u2014including a cradle-to-grave review of the \noil that the new rail line would carry from the basin \nto the national rail network. Pet.App.37a. The Board \ndoes not set oil extraction and refining policy. Nor is \nit positioned to judge whether the local effects of re-\nfining oil in Louisiana\u2014or any other state\u2014are more \nimportant than the benefits of a new rail line in Utah. \nThe Board authorizes the construction and operation \nof new rail lines, and Public Citizen wisely confines its \nenvironmental review to the proximate effects of that \naction. 541 U.S. at 767. The court of appeals\u2019 contrary \ndecision was wrong. \n\n \n \n24\nIII. The scope of NEPA review is a vital issue \nfor agencies, project proponents, and the \npublic. \nA. Recent, conflicting changes to the NEPA \nrules highlight the active dispute over \nPublic Citizen. \nThe courts of appeals are not the only forum for dis-\nagreement over Public Citizen\u2019s \u201climited statutory au-\nthority\u201d holding. The White House Council on Envi-\nronmental Quality, in amending the rules that imple-\nment NEPA, has also taken conflicting positions on \nPublic Citizen. In 2020, CEQ published a rule meant \nto \u201ccodify a key holding of Public Citizen\u201d and \u201cmake \nclear that effects\u201d under NEPA \u201cdo not include effects \nthat the agency has no authority to prevent . . . .\u201d 85 \nFed. Reg. 43304, 43344 (July 16, 2020). That rule \nmatched the circuit-majority rule. See, e.g., Kentucki-\nans, 746 F.3d at 710 (holding that \u201cagencies may rea-\nsonably limit their NEPA review to only those effects \nproximately caused by the actions over which they \nhave regulatory responsibility\u201d). \nBut a new Presidential administration interpreted \nPublic Citizen differently. So CEQ proposed a new \nrule in 2021 that explicitly rejected the 2020 rule\u2019s at-\ntempt \u201cto exclude \u2018effects that the agency had no abil-\nity to prevent due to its limited statutory authority\u2019\u201d \nover the relevant actions. 86 Fed. Reg. 55757, 55766 \n(Oct. 7, 2021) (quoting 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g)(2) (2020) \n(defining \u201ceffects\u201d under NEPA)). The new admin-\nistration\u2019s proposed rule said that a narrower defini-\ntion of effects \u201cunduly limit[ed] agency discretion.\u201d Id. \nAnd, to defend its reversal, the proposed rule offered \na conflicting take on Public Citizen. See id. \n\n \n \n25\nWhen the new administration finalized its NEPA \nrules, its Federal Register notice devoted an entire \nsection to the debate over Public Citizen. See 87 Fed. \nReg. 23453, 23464\u201365 (Apr. 20, 2022) (addressing \n\u201cComments on Department of Transportation v. Pub-\nlic Citizen\u201d). That section claimed that CEQ had \n\u201creexamined its interpretation of and reliance on the \nPublic Citizen decision in the 2020 rule.\u201d Id. at 23464. \nBut its reading of Public Citizen was policy-driven. \nThe 2020 rule, CEQ argued, was \u201cnot compelled by the \nopinion itself\u201d and did not \u201ccomport with\u201d the new ad-\nministration\u2019s \u201cview of the proper scope of effects anal-\nysis . . . .\u201d Id. Instead, CEQ\u2014like the D.C. Circuit\u2014\nelevated the \u201cprinciple of reasonable foreseeability\u201d \nabove Public Citizen\u2019s definition of effect. Id. at 23465. \nB. The reasonable foreseeability standard is \nan unmanageable line. \nCEQ\u2019s rival readings of Public Citizen have one \nthing in common: They rest on a consensus that NEPA \nreview too often creates more burdens than benefits. \nSee 85 Fed. Reg. 1684, 1691 (Jan. 10, 2020) (noting \nthat \u201cnumerous commenters\u201d wanted rule changes to \n\u201creduce unnecessary burdens and costs\u201d); 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 55759 (describing the new administration\u2019s review \nof the 2020 rules as ensuring a \u201csound and efficient\u201d \nNEPA process). That imbalance is why policymakers \nfor decades have been trying to streamline NEPA. See \nTripp, J. & Alley, N., Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Env\u2019t Re-\nview Process: Suggestions for Agency Reform, 12 \nN.Y.U. Env\u2019t L.J. 74, 77\u201378 (2003). In practice, NEPA \nencourages agencies to \u201ccover every bullet point in \n[their] plan with a paper shield,\u201d leading to \u201can un-\nwieldy document that is of little help in practical plan-\nning because useful details become lost amid the clut-\nter.\u201d Id. at 87. Yet CEQ\u2019s 2022 rule reinstated the \n\n \n \n26\nsame definition of effects that had applied since 1978. \nSee 86 Fed. Reg. at 55766. \nNEPA\u2019s inefficiency has also been the subject of re-\ncent legislative action. Recognizing that the environ-\nmental impact statement process takes an average of \n4.5 years, Exec. Office of the Pres., Council on Env\u2019t \nQuality, Env\u2019t Impact Statement Timelines (2010\u2013\n2018) (June 12, 2020), Congress amended NEPA to \nimpose time and page limits. See Pub. L. 118-5 \u00a7 321. \nAfter those changes, agencies must complete an envi-\nronmental impact statement within two years and in \nfewer than 150 pages (or 300 pages for actions \u201cof ex-\ntraordinary complexity\u201d). Id. \u00a7 321(b). \nBut these statutory changes do not alter the scope \nof an agency\u2019s environmental review. On that front, \nthe new legislation merely codifies the old NEPA \nrules: Agencies must study any \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble adverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided should the proposal be implemented.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 321(a) (emphasis added); see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) \n(2019) (defining \u201cindirect effects\u201d to include effects \nthat are \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d). Thus, NEPA still \ndoes not address the problem presented by this case. \nAn agency following the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reasonable \nforeseeability rule will find it hard\u2014if not impossi-\nble\u2014to write an impact statement in two years and \n150 pages. The scope of its review is just too broad. \nThat this burdensome NEPA review rule applies in \nthe Ninth and D.C. Circuits creates special problems. \nThe bulk of all NEPA litigation plays out in those two \ncircuits. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Env\u2019t Professionals, 2022 \nAnnual NEPA Report 26 (July 2022) (showing that \nthe Ninth and D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeals have \n\n \n \n27\ndecided more than 65% of NEPA cases since 2006).1 \nAnd because many agencies make their policy deci-\nsions at D.C.-based headquarters, projects from \naround the country may be challenged in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. See Aracely v. Nielson, 319 F. Supp. 3d 110, 128\u2013\n29 (D.D.C. 2019) (finding that \u201capplication of a pur-\nported policy that supposedly emanated from an \nagency located in the District of Columbia\u201d favored \nvenue in D.C.). This jurisdictional rule makes NEPA-\nbased forum-shopping inevitable. \nBoundless NEPA review hurts project proponents \nand the public too. The time and expense of environ-\nmental review is a barrier to all kinds of new pro-\njects\u2014including clean energy projects\u2014that prevents \nsome of them from ever getting off the ground. See \nMackenzie, A. & Ruiz, S., No, NEPA Really Is a Prob-\nlem for Clean Energy, Institute for Progress (Aug. 17, \n2023).2 More subtly, a costly environmental review \nprocess gives existing businesses \u201ca competitive ad-\nvantage,\u201d thereby \u201cundermin[ing] innovation\u201d and \nleaving in place \u201cexisting facilities that have more sig-\nnificant adverse environmental impacts.\u201d J. Wood, \nSpeeding Up Environmental Reviews Is Good for the \nEconomy and the Environment, The Hill (Feb. 6 \n2020). These costs hurt the public as much as they do \nthe project proponent trying to win agency approval \nfor a new idea. \nIn the end, the only way to stop runaway scoping \nfrom overwhelming the NEPA process is to consist-\nently apply this Court\u2019s holding in Public Citizen. \n \n \n1 Available at https://naep.memberclicks.net/assets/annual-re-\nport/NEPA_Annual_Report_2022.pdf. \n2 Available at https://ifp.org/no-nepa-really-is-a-problem-for-\nclean-energy/. \n\n \n \n28\nUnder that holding, each agency must consider the \nproximate effects of the actions over which it has reg-\nulatory authority. 541 U.S. at 767, 770. The mere abil-\nity to prevent an effect\u2014\u201cbut for\u201d causation\u2014is not \nenough to expand the scope of the agency\u2019s NEPA re-\nview. Id. at 767. Because the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nerases this vital \u201cmanageable line,\u201d id. at 767, this \nCourt\u2019s review is needed now. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 4, 2024  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJAY C.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.

This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

It will reveal which arguments the petitioner believes are most persuasive and how they address potential weaknesses, providing a clearer picture of the legal battleground. This is essential for predicting how the Court, particularly its conservative wing which is often skeptical of broad agency authority, will approach the NEPA scope question.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.6) because this action reinforces a fundamental and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: a systematic review of the core briefs in their logical sequence. Successfully using this action confirms the importance of analyzing the full dialectic of the parties' arguments (Petition -> Opposition/Response -> Reply). It helps refine the agent's general process by highlighting the specific, high-leverage value of the reply brief in synthesizing arguments and predicting the petitioner's focus during oral argument.",

Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \n \n \nNOVEMBER 2024 \n \nthe Board\u2019s consideration of the downline effects.  See Cnty. Resp. \nBr. 40-43 (responding to these arguments).

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.  Seeking to benefit ranchers, \n\n10 \nfarmers, tribal citizens, and others, the Coalition \nfocused its efforts on rail\u2014a cheaper, safer, and \ncleaner alternative to trucking.  In partnership with \nUinta Basin Railway, LLC, the Coalition sought \napproval from STB to build a new 88-mile rail line \nrunning southwest from the basin to central Utah that \nwould carry diverse commodities to and from the heart \nof \nthe \nbasin \nvia \nthe \nnational \nrail \nnetwork.  \nPet.App.192a. \nThe successor to the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, \nSTB \n\u201cis \nan \nindependent \nfederal \nagency \u2026 charged with the economic regulation of \nvarious modes of surface transportation, primarily \nfreight rail,\u201d but extending to \u201ccertain passenger rail \nmatters, the intercity bus industry, non-energy \npipelines, \nhousehold \ngoods \ncarriers\u2019 \ntariffs, \nand \u2026 non-contiguous domestic water transportation\u201d \nbetween \u201cthe mainland United States, Hawaii, \nAlaska,\u201d and the territories.  Surface Transp. Bd., \nAbout STB, https://bit.ly/3AjwrUO (last visited Aug. \n28, 2024).  As relevant here, Congress made STB \nresponsible for authorizing construction of new \nrailroad lines.  See generally 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901.  \nResponsibility for safety, as distinct from economic, \nregulation of the rails lies elsewhere, in the Federal \nRailroad \nAdministration, \nhoused \nwithin \nthe \nTransportation Department.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin., About FRA, \nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/about-fra \n(last \nvisited Aug. 28, 2024).  Reflecting STB\u2019s relatively \nlimited remit, Congress requires members of the \nBoard to have experience in transportation, economic \nregulation, or business.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a71301(b)(2).   \n\n11 \n2. To help secure financing for the new rail line, \nthe Coalition asked STB to conditionally approve the \nUinta Basin Railway project pending full NEPA \nreview.  Pet.App.204a.  Multiple environmental \ngroups objected, including the Center for Biological \nDiversity, which argued, among other things, that the \nnew rail line would not be financially viable because \n(it said) the basin did not need additional crude-oil \ntransportation \ncapacity. \n \nPet.App.197a. \n \nSTB \nultimately granted conditional approval, but made \nclear that \u201c[c]onstruction may not begin unless and \nuntil the Board issues a final decision\u201d \u201caddressing \nany potential environmental impacts.\u201d  Pet.App.209a.  \nSTB began its NEPA review of the proposed \nrailway in 2019.  Roughly a year and a half later, it \nissued a draft EIS describing the environmental \neffects of three alternative rail alignments and a no-\nbuild alternative.  Pet.App.79a.  STB took the next ten \nmonths to finalize the EIS, reviewing thousands of \ncomments from the public and requesting a report \nfrom the Fish & Wildlife Service about the project\u2019s \nimpact on protected species of fish in the Upper \nColorado River basin.  Pet.App.10a-11a, 50a-51a.  The \nresulting final EIS spanned 3,600 pages and analyzed \nhow \u201cconstruction and operation of the Railway\u201d \nwould impact \u201cwater resources, air quality, special \nstatus species like the greater sage-grouse, land use \nand recreation, local economies, cultural resources, \nand the Ute Indian tribe,\u201d among other things.  \nPet.App.11a; see JA94-105 (EIS table of contents).   \nThe EIS extensively discussed the possibility that \nthe railway might export waxy crude.  \u201cTo the extent \nthat the crude oil would be refined into fuels that \n\n12 \nwould be combusted to produce energy, emissions \nfrom the combustion of the fuels would produce,\u201d \nunder the maximum production scenario, \u201c0.8% of \nnationwide [greenhouse gas] emissions and 0.1% of \nglobal [greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d  Pet.App.106a.  \nThe EIS predicted that roughly half of the oil would be \ndelivered to the Texas Gulf Coast, and another third \nto the Louisiana Gulf Coast, though it could not \n\u201cidentify specific refineries.\u201d  Pet.App.34a, 111a.   \nCloser to the project itself, the EIS estimated the \nnumber of oil wells that would be added in the Basin \ndue to increased oil production enabled by the rail \nproject, while acknowledging that the location of such \n\u201cas yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects\u201d was uncertain.  Pet.App.31a.  The EIS also \nstudied the impact of additional rail traffic on the \nnational rail system, using modeling and historical \ndata to \u201cdetermine[] that the new Railway would lead \nto increased downline traffic, ranging from 0.4 to 9.5 \ntrains per day\u201d and, at most, \u201c0.89 additional \npredicted accidents per year.\u201d  Pet.App.40a.  STB \nultimately concluded that these \u201cminimal increases in \ntrain traffic on existing rail lines over which trains \nalready operate [were] unlikely to cause significant \nimpacts\u201d to vehicle safety and delay, rail safety, noise \nand vibration, air quality, or greenhouse gases.  \nPet.App.110a.   \nIn the end, the EIS concluded that one of the \nalternative rail alignments (the \u201cWhitmore Park \nAlternative\u201d) would \u201cresult in the fewest significant \nimpacts on the environment.\u201d  Pet.App.115a.  The EIS \nalso \nrecommended \nextensive \nenvironmental \n\n13 \nmitigation conditions.  Pet.App.76a; see Pet.App.149a-\n189a.   \nAfter considering the EIS, the Fish & Wildlife \nService\u2019s biological opinion, a separate geological \nstudy evaluating the risk of landslides and other \ngeologic movements, and more, STB issued a final \ndecision approving construction and operation of the \nWhitmore Park Alternative, subject to the mitigation \nrecommendations.  Pet.App.10a-11a.  STB\u2019s final \napproval of the 88-mile railway tracked Congress\u2019 \ndirective in the agency\u2019s organic statute\u2014which \ninstructs STB to approve rail-construction proposals \n\u201cunless [it] finds that such activities are inconsistent \nwith the public convenience and necessity,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n\u00a710901(c); see Mid-States Coal. for Progress v. STB, \n345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) (\u00a710901 creates \u201ca \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved\u201d)\u2014as STB found no basis to conclude from \nthe EIS that any adverse impacts of the new rail line \nwould outweigh the benefits to public convenience and \nnecessity, particularly in light of the extensive \nmitigation requirements the EIS imposed.   \n3. Various environmental groups led by the \nCenter for Biological Diversity sought review of STB\u2019s \ndecision in the D.C. Circuit.  They were joined by \nEagle County, Colorado, which lies hundreds of miles \ndistant from the Uinta Basin, and is significantly \ncloser geographically to Denver than the Utah border.  \nThe court of appeals consolidated the cases and \nallowed Seven County and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC, \nto intervene in defense of STB\u2019s decision.   \nAs relevant here, the Center faulted the EIS for \nnot \u201canalyz[ing] the potential for tens of thousands of \n\n14 \nadditional barrels of oil shipments daily and their \nprocessing in [Gulf Coast] locales to further worsen \npollution burdens.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  The Center likewise \nturned the potential for the railway to spur economic \ndevelopment in a \u201cvast area\u201d against the project, \nflyspecking the EIS for failing to analyze the potential \nfor \u201cwell and road construction, drilling, and truck \ntraffic [to] destroy and degrade habitat.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  \nAnd the Center knocked the EIS for not taking enough \nof \u201ca \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline,\u201d \u201cthe risk and impact of wildfires,\u201d or the \npotential impacts on \u201cthe Colorado River\u201d \u201cgiven the \nincreased rail traffic resulting from the Railway.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a, 46a. \nSTB\u2019s response was straightforward:  Under \nMetropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, it did not \nneed to consider those far-downstream (or down-track) \npotentialities, all of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited \nremit.  STB \u201ccannot regulate or mitigate\u201d any of the \nalleged potential \u201cimpacts\u201d the Center raised.  \nPet.App.31a.  Nor can it accurately predict them.  \n\u201c[A]ny \u2026 development in the Uinta Basin occurring as \na result of the [Railway] will be done in the future as \npart of as yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects that would occur on as yet unidentified \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(second alteration in original).  The amount of new \nconstruction is \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d given the \ninterplay between and among market forces, private \ndecisions, and regulatory actions outside STB\u2019s \ncontrol.  Pet.App.31a.  Likewise, although STB could \nidentify \u201cgeneral geographic regions\u201d where any oil \nmight go to be refined, \u201cthere [wa]s no way to predict \nor assess impacts to specific nearby communities from \n\n15 \nrefining that oil,\u201d because it was impossible to identify \nany one refinery.  Pet.App.31-32a.  And although STB \nestimated that marginal increases in rail traffic could \ncause 0.89 new accidents per year, accidents involving \na loaded crude train would occur far less frequently, \nand the evidence in the record suggested that \nmarginal wildfire risk \u201cwould not be significant.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a-43a, 46a.  \nNone of that was enough for the D.C. Circuit.  The \ndecision below concluded that STB\u2019s \u201cargument that it \nneed not consider effects it cannot prevent is simply \ninapplicable.\u201d  Pet.App.37a.  The court further held \nthat STB \u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could \nnot employ \u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the \naforementioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  \nPet.App.35a.  Invoking its decision in Sabal Trail, the \ncourt found that by taking the trouble to trace \nincreased waxy crude production in rural Utah to \nrefineries on the Gulf Coast, STB had bound itself to \ngo further to analyze the impact of refining activities \non Gulf Coast communities, including contributions to \nclimate \nchange. \n \nPet.App.33a-36a; \nsee \nalso \nPet.App.66a.  The court thus vacated the order and \nremanded for STB to redo the EIS.  Pet.App.70a-71a.1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA imposes a sensible procedural requirement \nthat federal agencies consider a proposed project\u2019s \nenvironmental impact before greenlighting it.  It is not \nsupposed to operate as a substantive obstacle to \n \n1 The D.C. Circuit also remanded for STB to address non-NEPA \nissues and for Fish & Wildlife to address an aspect of its biological \nopinion.  Those non-NEPA issues are not before this Court. \n\n16 \nprojects, requiring agencies to consider remote \npossibilities or empowering project opponents to win a \nwar of attrition by repeatedly forcing agencies to \nconsider just one more possibility.  This Court\u2019s \nprecedents ensure that NEPA strikes a reasonable \nbalance by limiting an agency\u2019s obligations to \nconsidering environmental effects with a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d to the agency\u2019s proposed \naction, and then reviewing the agency\u2019s analysis \nunder NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  The D.C. \nCircuit has lost sight of those limits, as this case \ndramatically illustrates.  STB studied all that NEPA \nrequires and then some in a 3,600-page EIS, but \nenvironmental \nobjectors \nand \nthe \nD.C. \nCircuit \ndemanded still more, including an exhaustive review \nof matters as remote as the impact of additional oil \nrefining (that the new railway theoretically could \nspur) on air quality on the Gulf Coast.  Invoking its \nSabal Trail decision, the D.C. Circuit effectively \npunished STB for going beyond what NEPA requires, \nholding that STB\u2019s efforts to trace increased crude \nproduction to Gulf Coast refineries obligated it to \nstudy environmental effects thousands of miles \nremoved from the project at issue.  There is simply no \nrole under NEPA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s precedents for \nstymying \ndevelopment \nprojects \nbased \non \nenvironmental effects that are so wildly remote in \ngeography and time.  This Court should reaffirm that \nNEPA embodies a demanding form of proximate \ncause, not mere but-for causation, and reverse. \nThis Court has been clear.  \u201cNEPA requires\u201d \nstudying an environmental effect only when there is \n\u201c\u2018a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u2019\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\n17 \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d\u2014\u201cbetween \nthe \nenvironmental \neffect and the alleged cause,\u201d and only when the \nagency \u201chas \u2026 statutory authority over\u201d the \u201ceffect,\u201d \nand thus the \u201cability to prevent\u201d it.  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767, 770 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at \n774).  While the D.C. Circuit cited this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, it required STB\u2019s NEPA analysis to \ntransgress the limits of proximate cause and STB\u2019s \npurview, while giving STB no leeway to make \nreasonable judgments about dim and distant effects. \nThat was legal error.  This Court\u2019s repeated \nemphasis on proximate cause and \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship[s]\u201d between a project and its \nenvironmental effects, Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nrules out the need to consider effects that are far \nremoved in geography and time or that are separated \nby multiple intervening causes that themselves are \nnon-environmental and highly uncertain.  It strains \ncredulity to contend that laying 88 miles of track in \nrural Utah is proximately related to climate change or \nenvironmental harm in Gulf Coast communities.  So \ntoo for potential downline train accidents:  It beggars \nbelief that the legally relevant (i.e., proximate) cause \nof an accident several States away could somehow be \nthe Uinta Basin Railway\u2014and not, for instance, the \nengineer of the relevant train, the train manufacturer, \nor the operator of the relevant track.  Even if the \nproject could be said to be the but-for cause, a tort \nplaintiff suing the agency or the Uinta Basin Railway \nfor a train accident a thousand miles away (let alone \nfor climate change) would be laughed out of court.  The \nresult should be no different just because plaintiffs \nchallenge an EIS under NEPA.  \u201c\u2018[F]or want of a nail, \na kingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \n\n18 \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv\u2019r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nThe decision below also defies NEPA\u2019s \u201cpractical \n\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u201d  N.Y. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. \nKleppe, 97 S.Ct. 4, 6 (1976) (decision of Marshall, J.).  \nNEPA requires agencies to consider proposals \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), not track down \nevery remote or minimal impact.  As one moves from \nthe direct effects of the project to increasingly remote \neffects and mere risks, the agency has discretion to \nignore them or give them more cursory treatment, and \nthe rule of reason prevents a court from forcing an \nagency to consider \u201cinformation\u201d that the agency \ndeems of little \u201cvalue\u201d to the \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374 \n(1989).  For example, whatever the proper solution to \nglobal climate change, the issue must be addressed \nglobally (or at least nationally by EPA), not by \nblocking an 88-mile rail line bringing much-needed \neconomic stability and development to a remote corner \nof Utah.  In practical terms, \u201cno rule of reason worthy \nof that title,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767, would \n\u201coblige\u201d an agency responsible for approving rail \nprojects \n\u201cto \nexpend \nconsiderable \nresources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise\u201d on issues \u201cnot otherwise \nrelevant to [its] congressionally assigned functions,\u201d \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776; see also Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 769.   \nThe decision below is a poster child for converting \na sensible procedural check into a morass that \n\n19 \noperates as a substantive roadblock to development.  \nThe clearest way to put an end to this excess is for this \nCourt to reverse and make clear that the EIS here is \nsufficient.  88 miles of track should not require 3,600 \npages of EIS, let alone a remand for further study of \nwildly remote matters.  This Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nText And Precedent Answer The Question \nPresented In The Negative. \nA. This \nCourt \nHas \nMade \nClear \nThat \nProximate Cause and a Rule of Reason \nSensibly Limit the Scope of NEPA \nReview. \n1. This Court decided Metropolitan Edison in \n1983, four years after a high-profile accident at the \nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant prompted mass \nevacuations and a national reckoning about the safety \nof nuclear power.  Immediately following the accident, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) ordered \nthe power company to shutter the plant indefinitely.  \n460 U.S. at 769.  When the power company sought \npermission to resume operations, the Atomic Energy \nAct required NRC to act as \u201cnecessary or desirable \u2026 \nto protect health or to minimize danger to life or \nproperty.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b).  NEPA also required \nthe Commission to prepare an EIS.  In Metropolitan \nEdison, this Court addressed what environmental \nimpacts NRC needed to consider under NEPA before \nauthorizing Three Mile Island operations to resume. \nThe Court began with statutory text.  Under the \nversion then in effect, NEPA required agencies to \nstudy \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmental effects which \n\n20 \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1975).  As \nthen-Justice Rehnquist explained, this language did \nnot mean that NEPA required the Commission to \nconsider every possible adverse effect of restarting \nThree Mile Island.  460 U.S. at 774.  Rather, \u201cthe \nterms \u2018environmental effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental \nimpact\u2019\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u201d \nakin \nto \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d \u201cbetween\u201d the agency action \u201cand \nthe effect at issue.\u201d  Id.; see also Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 \n(2014) (explaining the settled principle that federal \nstatutes often should be \u201cconstrued \u2026 to incorporate a \nrequirement of proximate causation\u201d). \nWith that statutory construction in hand, the \nCourt unanimously concluded that things like the \n\u201crelease of low-level radiation, increased fog in the \nHarrisburg area (caused by operation of the plant\u2019s \ncooling towers), and the release of warm water into the \nSusquehanna River\u201d were properly on the table for \nNEPA purposes.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775.  \nThese effects, after all, were \u201cproximately related\u201d to \nthe plant resuming operations.  Id. at 774.   \nOn the flip side, the Commission\u2019s EIS did not \nneed to account for \u201cthe potential psychological health \neffects\u201d of reopening the plant on members of the \nsurrounding community, let alone the impact on far-\nflung relatives living hundreds or thousands of miles \naway.  Id. at 771, 774, 777-78.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court did not deny that locals were \nstill reeling from the recent brush with disaster, or \nthat reopening the plant \u201cmay well cause\u201d residents to \n\n21 \nsuffer \n\u201cpsychological \nhealth \nproblems \n\u2026 \nand \naccompanying physical disorders\u201d that derive from \n\u201c\u2018tension and fear.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 774.  But NEPA is \nconcerned with effects of agency action on \u201cthe \nphysical environment\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201c\u2018the air, land and \nwater\u2019\u201d\u2014and such harms were \u201csimply too remote \nfrom the physical environment to justify requiring the \nNRC to evaluate the psychological health damage \u2026 \nthat may be caused by renewed operation of [the \nplant].\u201d  Id. at 773, 774 (emphasis omitted). \nFurthermore, the resumption of operations was \nnot the proximate cause of the health effects \nrespondents raised; those effects instead would \u201cflow \ndirectly from the risk of [a nuclear] accident.\u201d  Id. at \n775 (emphasis added; alteration in original) (quoting \nMetro. Edison Br. for Resps. 23).  \u201cBut a risk of an \naccident is not an effect on the physical environment\u201d \neither.  Id.  \u201cA risk is, by definition, unrealized in the \nphysical world.\u201d  Id. at 767.  What matters under \nNEPA\u2014and what defines the scope of review\u2014is the \nrelationship between the project at issue and changes \nin the physical environment caused by it.  \u201cNEPA does \nnot require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua \nrisk,\u201d of a project moving forward, as opposed to the \nreasonably foreseeable effects of the project itself.  Id. \nat 779.   \nFinally, the Court warned against allowing NEPA \nto be converted into a vehicle for environmental policy \ndisputes.  \u201cThe political process, and not NEPA, \nprovides the appropriate forum in which to air policy \ndisagreements.\u201d  Id. at 777. \nMetropolitan Edison all but resolves this case.  If \nNEPA did not require consideration of allegedly direct \n\n22 \nhealth consequences of the ripped-from-the-headlines \nrisk of another nuclear meltdown before restarting \nThree Mile Island, then it is hard to demand that \nSTB\u2019s EIS here consider the risk of accidents on \nexisting tracks hundreds of miles away, let alone the \nremote and theoretical risk that the Uinta Basin \nRailway could cause future harm to communities near \nGulf Coast refineries.  But if any doubt remained post-\nMetropolitan Edison, Public Citizen settled it. \n2. The question in Public Citizen was whether, \nwhen deciding what safety regulations should govern \nMexican trucks operating in the United States, the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration needed \nto consider the Mexican trucks\u2019 contribution to \ndomestic air pollution.  541 U.S. at 756.  Unlike \nMetropolitan Edison, the question was not risk\u2014e.g., \nthe \nrisk \nthat \nMexican \ntrucks \nwould \nhave \nenvironmentally damaging accidents in the United \nStates or impact traffic patterns in ways that affected \ndistant communities\u2014but the certainty that Mexican \ntrucks would cause additional air pollution.  After all, \nthe regulations were the last thing standing in the \nway of President Bush\u2019s directive to allow Mexican \ntrucks to operate in the United States.  Id. at 765-66.   \nNevertheless, even though the agency action was \nplainly the but-for cause of that increased pollution, \nthe Court concluded that it landed outside NEPA\u2019s \nrequired scope.  Id. at 770.  The Court clarified that \u201ca \n\u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is insufficient to make an \nagency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA \nand the relevant regulations.\u201d  Id. at 767.  Rather, \nNEPA requires agencies to consider only those effects \nproximately caused by the proposed action.  Id.  Given \n\n23 \nthe President\u2019s order, the agency could not simply \ndecline to issue regulations, and so\u2014while the agency \naction allowing the Mexican trucks into the country \nwas plainly a but-for cause of increased pollution\u2014\n\u201cthe President,\u201d \u201cnot\u201d any \u201caction\u201d by the agency, was \n\u201cthe legally relevant cause.\u201d  Id. at 760-61, 769; see \nalso id. at 767 (noting that \u201cproximate cause analysis \nturns on,\u201d among other things, \u201cconsiderations of the \n\u2018legal responsibility\u2019 of actors\u201d (quoting W. Page \nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 275 \n(5th ed. 1984))). \nThe Court likewise invoked NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason,\u201d which ensures that agencies need not engage \nin endless environmental reviews that would frustrate \nthe agency\u2019s primary mission or \u201cserve no purpose in \nlight of NEPA\u2019s regulatory scheme as a whole.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents there argued that while the President\u2019s \ndecision required the agency to allow the trucks into \nthe country, the agency still needed to consider \npollution, on the theory that it might matter on the \nmargins when selecting among the menu of possible \nsafety regulations.  This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would require an \nagency\u201d against its will to study environmental effects \nfalling outside its \u201cability to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 767, 770.   \n3. Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen suffice \nto resolve this case in petitioners\u2019 favor, but they are \nfar from the only decisions of this Court holding that \nonly proximate environmental effects count, and an \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis need not consider remote \nenvironmental effects, non-environmental effects, \npure risk, or matters beyond the agency\u2019s remit. \n\n24 \nIn Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \nfor instance, the Forest Service authorized the \ndevelopment of a major new ski resort in a \u201csparsely \npopulated area\u201d of the Cascade Mountains.  490 U.S. \nat 337.  The resort quickly got bogged down in \nlitigation.  Environmental groups challenged the \nadequacy of the EIS, which recognized that off-site \ndevelopment on private land \u201ccould \u2026 degrad[e] \u2026 \nexisting air quality\u201d but did not delve deeply into the \nair-quality issue.  Id. at 339-40, 344-45.  They further \nargued the EIS needed to conduct a \u201cworst case\u201d \nanalysis of impacts to the local mule-deer population \nand that the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that those \neffects were \u201cuncertain[]\u201d did not suffice.  Id. at 343, \n347.  This Court rejected both arguments with a nod \nto NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Because the county, not \nthe Forest Service, had primary jurisdiction over air \nquality, \u201c[t]he off-site effects on air quality and on the \nmule deer herd\u201d would \u201cbe subject to regulation by \nother \ngovernmental \nbodies\u201d \nwith \nprimary \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the effects and \u201cauthority to \nmitigate them.\u201d  Id. at 350, 352.  \u201c[I]t would be \nincongruous to conclude that the Forest Service\u201d was \nresponsible to develop related mitigation measures.  \nId. at 352-53.2 \n \n2 Unfortunately, that conclusion was not enough to save the \nresort:  Despite heralding the region as \u201cthe best potential \ndestination ski resort in the United States,\u201d Aspen Ski \nCorporation ultimately \u201cbec[a]me weary of the seemingly never-\nending lawsuits\u201d and sold the property to another developer, who \nitself \u201cran out of cash\u201d after \u201cspen[ding] roughly $12 million on \nland and legal fees.\u201d  Ryan Flynn, Early Winters Resort, WA:  A \nSki Hill That Never Was, SnowBrains (Jan. 8, 2024), \n \n\n25 \nThe Court reached a similar conclusion for similar \nreasons in Vermont Yankee.  There, the Court brushed \nback the suggestion that an EIS must \u201cferret out every \npossible\u201d way to mitigate environmental effects, \nparticularly when those effects fall into the domain of \n\u201cstate public utility commissions or similar bodies.\u201d  \n435 U.S. at 550-51, 558.  And in Baltimore Gas and \nElectric, this Court blessed NRC\u2019s use of generic rules \nto evaluate the environmental effects of nuclear power \ngeneration generally, rather than via a power-plant-\nspecific analysis.  As the Court there put it, \u201cCongress \ndid not enact NEPA \u2026 so that an agency would \ncontemplate the environmental impact of an action as \nan abstract exercise\u201d; agencies \u201cha[ve] discretion\u201d \nunder \nNEPA \nto \n\u201ccho[ose]\u201d \nto \n\u201cevaluate \n\u2026 \nenvironmental impact[s]\u201d \u201cgenerically,\u201d rather than \nspecifically, to \u201cfurther[]\u201d \u201c[a]dministrative efficiency \nand consistency of decision.\u201d  462 U.S. at 100-01. \n* * * \nThe lessons of this Court\u2019s NEPA cases are clear, \nyet they all seemed lost on the D.C. Circuit in its \ndecision below.  NEPA requires agencies to study only \nenvironmental effects proximately caused by the \nproposed agency action.  NEPA does not require \nagencies to study remote environmental effects, non-\nenvironmental effects, risks, or factors outside the \nagency\u2019s control.  Nor does an agency have to consider \nevery effect that may (or may not) flow from conduct \nor events that a proposed project may (or may not) \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4fAPp9W.  That result underscores the risk that \nNEPA litigation allows environmental opponents of agency-\napproved projects to lose the NEPA battle while still winning the \nwar of attrition. \n\n26 \nspur, just because the agency could ensure that those \npotential future consequences never arise by denying \na permit and cutting off the proposed action \naltogether.  Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nboth say so directly and confirm that the D.C. Circuit \nerred in requiring STB to consider far-downstream \nconsequences as part of its NEPA review.   \nThat proximate-cause limit tethered to the project \nitself is buttressed by NEPA\u2019s rule of reason, which \nputs sensible limits on what an agency must study.  In \nPublic Citizen, even though pollution from Mexican \ntrucks was a certain, direct environmental effect of the \nFederal \nMotor \nCarrier \nSafety \nAdministration \npromulgating its safety regulations, the agency did \nnot need to study pollution from increased truck \ntraffic, because the agency \u201cha[d] no statutory \nauthority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to \nestablish environmental requirements unrelated to \nmotor carrier safety.\u201d  541 U.S. at 759.  Likewise in \nRobertson, even if air pollution from off-site \ndevelopment was a certain, direct environmental \neffect of licensing the ski resort, the Forest Service \nwould not need to study it, because it would fall within \nthe County\u2019s authority.  Once again, those cases \nconfirm that the D.C. Circuit erred in holding that \nSTB must conduct a full-scale NEPA review of issues \nfar outside its limited remit, but well within the \npurview of other agencies\u2019 authority\u2014especially when \nthose other agencies can address such issues more \ncomprehensively, rather than making a relatively \nmodest infrastructure project the scapegoat for \neverything from upstream mining to downstream \naccident risks and climate change. \n\n27 \nB. The \nBUILDER \nAct \nButtresses \nthe \nLimitations on NEPA Review That This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Recognize and Enforce. \nThis Court has long \u201capplied the standard \nrequirement of proximate cause to actions under \nfederal statutes\u201d even though \u201cthe text did not \nexpressly provide for it.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nMcBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting).  As of 2023, NEPA\u2019s text does provide for \nit.  While not directly applicable to this pre-Act project, \nCongress codified in the BUILDER Act what this \nCourt has long held, making clear that the scope of \nNEPA \nreview \nturns \non \nforeseeability \nand \nreasonableness\u2014i.e., proximate cause\u2014and that \nNEPA does not alter statutory provisions delimiting \nan agency\u2019s authority or mission. \nAs amended by the BUILDER Act, NEPA now \nprovides as follows: \n(2) [A]ll agencies of the Federal Government \nshall\u2014 \n(C) \u2026 except where compliance would be \ninconsistent \nwith \nother \nstatutory \nrequirements, \ninclude \nin \nevery \nrecommendation or report on proposals for \nlegislation and other major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on\u2014 \n(i) \nthe \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nenvironmental impact effects of the \nproposed agency action,; \n\n28 \n(ii) \nany \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal be implemented,; [and] \n(iii) \na \nreasonable \nrange \nof \nalternatives to the proposed agency \naction, including an analysis of any \nnegative environmental impacts of \nnot \nimplementing \nthe \nproposed \nagency action in the case of a no \naction \nalternative, \nthat \nare \ntechnically \nand \neconomically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposal[.]  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332 (2023) (additions underlined; \ndeletions stricken). \nThese \nclarifying \nchanges \nunderscore \nthat \nCongress has embraced this Court\u2019s decisions, which \nkeep NEPA as a manageable procedural check, rather \nthan a substantive roadblock to infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The BUILDER Act makes explicit what \nthis Court already held was implicit by textually \nadopting the language of proximate cause.  See, e.g., \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) \n(proximate cause is \u201coften explicated in terms of \nforeseeability\u201d).  That strongly reinforces this Court\u2019s \ndecisions.  After all, if Congress can \u201ccarry forward\u201d \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nstatutory \nprecedents \nmerely \nby \n\u201cperpetuating the [same] wording\u201d (i.e., doing nothing \nin response to this Court\u2019s statutory decisions), then \nCongress\u2019 affirmative choice to adopt new language \nembracing prior statutory precedents of this Court \nsupplies a strong signal that those precedents were \n\n29 \ncorrect.  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \nThe BUILDER Act likewise embraces the rule of \nreason recognized in Public Citizen.  The Act\u2019s title \nunderscores Congress\u2019 intent for NEPA review to be \nnarrow and efficient, rather than unwieldy and anti-\ndevelopment.  See id. at 221 (noting that statutory \ntitles provide a \u201cpermissible indicator[] of meaning\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the Act continues to limit NEPA to projects \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and it now \nexpressly \nabsolves \nagencies \nof \nconsidering \nalternatives \nthat \nare \nnot \n\u201creasonable,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) (2023), and presumptively limits the \nEIS process to no more than \u201c2 years\u201d and an EIS itself \nto \u201c150 pages,\u201d id. \u00a74336a(e)(1), (g)(1).  What is more, \nit makes explicit that when Congress assigns an \nagency to administer a decidedly pro-development \nstatute\u2014as \nit \nhas \ndone \nwith \nSTB \nand \nrail \nconstruction, see p.10, supra\u2014NEPA does not stand in \nthe way; the agency need only weigh alternatives that \n\u201cmeet the purpose and need of the proposal\u201d and \nevaluate the cost of doing nothing.  Id. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) \n(2023).   \nAt bottom, the BUILDER Act not only endorses \nthis Court\u2019s focus on proximate cause and underscores \nthat limits on an agency\u2019s regulatory mission and its \nsubject-matter portfolio are baked into the rule of \nreason, but illustrates the folly in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nboil-the-ocean mandate here. \n\n30 \nII. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA And This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Applying It.   \nThis Court\u2019s NEPA precedents and Congress\u2019 \nrecent and emphatic reaffirmation of them confirm \nthat NEPA envisions a procedural cross-check, not a \nsubstantive roadblock.  And NEPA\u2019s procedural cross-\ncheck is not designed to be unduly onerous or to \nresemble a Sisyphean task, where there is always one \nadditional and increasingly remote effect or risk that \nmust be considered.  To the contrary, NEPA strikes a \nsensible balance where an agency need only consider \nproximate environmental effects and judgments about \nwhat to consider are protected from endless second-\nguessing by a rule of reason.  Striking this balance \nensures that NEPA will continue to facilitate \u201cfully \ninformed and well-considered decision[s]\u201d while \nremaining \u201cbounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551, 558.  It likewise ensures that \n\u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA, provides the \nappropriate \nforum \nin \nwhich \nto \nair \npolicy \ndisagreements\u201d with a project that meets all the \nsubstantive criteria for agency approval.  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 777. \nThe decision below upsets that balance and \nthreatens to block vital infrastructure development \nunder the guise of just a little more process.  The \nimpact (if any) of 88 new miles of track in an isolated \ncorner of Utah on train accidents hundreds of miles \naway or the air quality of refining communities on the \nGulf Coast or on climate change is the very definition \nof remote, not proximate, cause.  And despite the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s view that NEPA demands a never-ending \nprocess, it was eminently reasonable for an agency \n\n31 \nresponsible for administering an explicitly pro-\ndevelopment statute to decline to consider de minimis \nenvironmental impacts that are little more than the \ninevitable consequences of development and that \nshould be regulated (if at all) as part of a \ncomprehensive scheme administered by a different \nagency.  To state the obvious, the solution to the global \nissue of climate change does not lie in blocking 88 \nmiles of track or keeping the Uinta Basin isolated from \nthe national economy.   \nA. The \nDecision \nBelow \nDemanded \nConsideration of Non-Proximate and \nNon-Environmental Effects. \n1. If a train collision occurs in the middle of \nColorado and winds up in court, there are plenty of \npotential tort defendants:  the hapless train engineer, \nthe careless builder of the malfunctioning train, the \nmanufacturer of the unsafe track, the negligent \ndispatcher who was on duty, or perhaps even the \nreckless safety regulator who ignored advice to lower \nthe relevant speed limit.  Only the most creative of \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2014and least successful, given the \nwell-established limits of proximate cause\u2014would \nthink to sue the operator of an 88-mile rail line that \nbegins and ends in rural Utah or the regulator who \napproved it on the theory that it increased downline \naccident risk by less than a percentage point. \nThat would be true a fortiori for consequences on \nthe ground (or in the air above it) from increased waxy \ncrude refining on the Gulf Coast\u2014and doubly so of \neffects of such refining on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as \nchanges or increases in refining are strictly regulated \nby other agencies.  Not even Helen Palsgraf could have \n\n32 \ndreamed of a judicial opinion finding 88 miles of track \nwholly in rural Utah to be the proximate cause of \nfuture air pollution on the Gulf Coast and its \nramifications for Gulf refining communities\u2014to say \nnothing of one linking the railway to monsoons in the \nSouth Pacific.   \nWhile well-established principles of proximate \ncause would stop such fanciful lawsuits at the starting \ngate, the D.C. Circuit put STB on the hook for \nstudying similarly remote effects of approving 88 \nmiles of rail line in rural Utah.  The D.C. Circuit \njustified that burden not by expressly finding air \npollution on the Gulf Coast or downline accidents to be \nproximately caused by the project, but by emphasizing \nthat STB has the authority to deny the permit \nnecessary for the project if it \u201cfinds that such activities \nare inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d  See Pet.App.36a-37a; 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901(c). \nThat analytical leap hopelessly conflates but-for \nand proximate cause.  An agency can avoid any \nnumber of remote impacts and risks of harmful \nactivity by denying a required permit, because the \nvery nature of a permit makes it a necessary but-for \ncause of the permitted activity.  But this Court has \nrepeatedly rejected the notion that NEPA embodies \nsuch a \u201c\u2018but-for\u2019 causation\u201d standard.  Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 767.  In its place, and in order to protect \nthe \u201cmanageable\u201d and balanced approach that \nCongress intended, see Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776, \nNEPA requires agencies to study only proximate \nenvironmental effects.  In light of \u201cthe congressional \nconcerns that led to the enactment of NEPA,\u201d \u201c[s]ome \neffects\u201d of a proposed project \u201cthat are \u2018caused by\u2019 a \n\n33 \nchange in the physical environment in the sense of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation, will nonetheless not fall within [NEPA] \nbecause the causal chain is too attenuated.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nStated more succinctly, proximate cause is the \ntouchstone for an EIS\u2014and where proximate cause \nends, so ends the scope of what NEPA requires.   \nMoreover, as this Court has emphasized, the focus \nof the proximate-cause inquiry is on the project itself, \nnot on subsequent activities a project may someday \nenable.  See id. at 771-79; pp.20-21, supra.  NEPA \nrequires \u201ca detailed statement\u201d of \u201cthe environmental \nimpact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2019) \n(emphases added).3  Thus, \u201cto decide what kind of an \n[EIS] need be prepared, it is necessary first to describe \naccurately the \u2026 \u2018action\u2019 being taken.\u201d  Aberdeen & \nRockfish R.R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U.S. 289, 322 (1975); \nsee also Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 395-402 \n(1976).  And the same is true for the proximate-cause \ninquiry.  \u201cTo determine whether [NEPA] requires \nconsideration of a particular effect, we must look at \nthe relationship between that effect and the change in \nthe physical environment caused by the major federal \naction at issue.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773 \n(emphasis added).  What matters, in other words, is \nthe relationship between the project and changes in \nthe physical environment caused by it.  \n \n3 The language under the BUILDER Act is substantially \nsimilar.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2023) (requiring \u201ca detailed \nstatement\u201d of, inter alia, \u201creasonably foreseeable environmental \neffects of the proposed agency action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed agency action\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnder that rubric, changes in the physical \nenvironment that have a reasonably close causal \nrelationship to a proposed project must be considered \nas part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review.  But changes in \nthe physical environment that are remote from a \nproposed project in space and time need not be \nconsidered as part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review, \nbecause \nthose \neffects \nare, \nby \ndefinition, \nnot \nproximately caused by the project.  Likewise, \nenvironmental effects that flow from subsequent \nactions that the project may (or may not) ultimately \nenable need not be considered under NEPA, as such \nuncertain potentialities likewise lie well beyond the \nscope of proximate environmental effects. \nThat sensible proximate-cause limit focused on \nthe project itself is reinforced by NEPA\u2019s direction to \nconsider alternatives.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii).  \nIt makes perfect sense for an agency to consider three \nalternative rail routes to connect the Uinta Basin with \nthe national rail system, as well as a no-action \nalternative.  See pp.11-13, supra.  If one route \nendangers important habitat or threatens a pristine \nriver, then the EIS helpfully directs the agency to an \nalternative.  But it is completely infeasible to consider \nevery alternative for the cargo that could be carried on \ndistant rail lines, the development the rail line could \nprecipitate in the Uinta Basin, or the permutations for \nthe mix and quantity of crude refined on the Gulf \nCoast.  And NEPA directs agencies to consider all \nalternatives in the same manner, not to go to the ends \nof the Earth vis-\u00e0-vis the principal proposal and give \nonly cursory consideration to the alternatives.  Thus, \nthe only conclusion consistent with NEPA\u2019s text and \nthe imperative to keep NEPA analysis within \n\n35 \nreasonable bounds is to consider only a manageable \nrange of proximate environmental effects of all \nalternatives.  Any other conclusion would leave \nagencies (and courts) with impossible burdens and \nwithout \u201ca manageable line between those causal \nchanges that may make an actor responsible for an \neffect and those that do not.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7). \n2. The D.C. Circuit lost sight of these important \nprinciples here.  The court of appeals perceived three \nfailings in the EIS:  failing to adequately consider \n(1) \u201cthe effects of increased crude oil refining on Gulf \nCoast \ncommunities \nin \nLouisiana \nand \nTexas\u201d; \n(2) \u201cdownline effects of projected increases in spills \nand accidents from additional oil trains traveling the \nexisting Union Pacific rail line\u201d; and (3) the \u201cupline \nimpacts on vegetation or special status species\u201d that \nmight be found near potential well sites if the new \nrailway \nspurs \nindependent \ndevelopment.  \nPet.App.12a-13a; see also Pet.App.30a-37a, 40a-47a.   \nJust quoting those supposedly \u201comitted\u201d impacts \nconfirms that the D.C. Circuit went well beyond \nproximate environmental effects of adding 88 miles of \nrail in rural Utah.  First, any impact on Gulf Coast \ncommunities in Louisiana and Texas is wildly remote \nin multiple dimensions.  There are multiple States, \nand more than a thousand miles, between the 88 miles \nof track in Utah and the Gulf Coast.   \nAnd there is arguably an even greater gap \nbetween the project and any material increase in \ncrude oil refining in those remote areas.  Even \ncrediting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s apparent assumption that \nall crude shipped on a common-carrier rail line will \n\n36 \nend up at a specific destination in the Gulf Coast, \nwhether there will even be an increase in crude oil \nrefining on the Gulf Coast depends on the amount of \nwaxy crude shipped on the new line and how that \ncompares to the status quo ante with truck \ntransportation, see CADCJA230, \u201cthe ability and \nwillingness\u201d of the refineries in those areas to receive \nand process waxy crude oil, JA477, and (among many \nother things) the actions of myriad local, state, and \nfederal regulators who already directly oversee the \nrefineries\u2019 operations.  Figuring out \u201cthe climate \neffects of the combustion of the fuel intended to be \nextracted\u201d thus depends on guessing which part (or \nparts) of the Gulf Coast might receive and refine the \noil; speculating whether and to what degree waxy \ncrude from the Uinta Basin will augment existing \nrefining activity, rather than just displace refining \ncrude from elsewhere (and, if so, what kind of crude is \ndisplaced); estimating the relative impacts of refining \none form of crude versus another; and then inferring \nthat the environmental protections already in place \n(due to action by EPA and state regulators, not STB) \nwould fail to protect the surrounding community from \nany marginal increase in refining output.  All of those \nare \u201cmiddle links\u201d that render \u201cthe effects of increased \ncrude oil refining on Gulf Coast communities in \nLouisiana and Texas\u201d far too remote from a new \nrailway line in rural Utah and far too speculative to \njustify NEPA review of those highly contingent \npotentialities.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775. \nThe \u201cdownline\u201d effects of STB\u2019s decision are, if \nanything, even more contingent and remote.  As part \nof its NEPA review, STB used models to predict how \nmany trains would be added to other rail lines.  Based \n\n37 \non that prediction, STB estimated that the additional \ntrain cars would result in less than one\u20140.89, to be \nexact\u2014additional \ntrain \naccident \neach \nyear.  \nPet.App.40a-41a.  And even that number oversells the \npoint.  Where such an accident would occur; whether \nit would be serious or minor; whether it would involve \ncars that were empty or full; and whether it would \ncause any damage to the physical environment \nhundreds or thousands of miles removed from the \nUinta Basin are all matters of complete guesswork.  As \nnoted, any plaintiff trying to sue the operators of the \n88 miles of rural Utah track (or STB) for a train \naccident in Colorado, Louisiana, or anywhere in \nbetween would be laughed out of court.  The most that \ncould be said is that STB approval of the 88 miles at \nissue here was a but-for cause of the future accident.  \nTo argue that the accident was a proximate \nenvironmental effect drains those words of meaning \nand defies this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThe same is true of the potential that, if the \nrailway spurs new development in the Uinta Basin, \nthat new development may have effects on the \nsurrounding environs.  See Pet.App.31a.  Initially, \nthat risk depends on the assumption that the new rail \nline will carry substantial amounts of waxy crude\u2014by \nno means a certainty, as evidenced by the fact that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity previously contended \nthat market demand for oil could never sustain the \nrailway. \n \nSee \nPet.App.197a-198a. \n \nAnd \nthe \nassumptions spin out from there.  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nown \ndescription \nof \nSTB\u2019s \nsupposed \nomissions \nunderscores that it has gone well beyond proximate \nenvironmental effects of the project itself.  The D.C. \nCircuit demanded consideration of \u201cas yet unknown \n\n38 \nand unplanned independent projects that would occur \non as yet unidentified private, state, tribal, or federal \nland,\u201d \u201cundertaken \u2018by as yet unknown entities and \nlicensed or permitted by other federal agencies, state \nand local governments, or the Ute Tribe, depending on \nthe location of the development,\u2019\u201d at a level that is \n\u201csimply unknown and unknowable.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(quoting CADC.Gov.Br.35-36).  The court should have \nstopped well before the fourth \u201cunknown.\u201d  None of \nthose unknowns is a proximate consequence of the \nproject, as opposed to a potential consequence of \nindependent development that the project may (or \nmay not) spur and that could pose some harm to the \nenvironment, \ndespite \nwhatever \nenvironmental \nanalysis is required if, and when, any concrete future \nprojects materialize. \nTo be sure, an agency must make some educated \nassumptions about environmental effects that are \ncertain but hard to quantify, to \u201censure[] that [those] \nimportant \neffects \nwill \nnot \nbe \noverlooked \nor \nunderestimated,\u201d and to \u201cprovide[] a springboard for \npublic comment.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.  In \nMetropolitan Edison, for example, NRC needed to \nmake educated assumptions about the \u201crelease of low-\nlevel radiation, increased fog in the [surrounding] area \n(caused by operation of the plant\u2019s cooling towers), and \nthe release of warm water into [a nearby] River.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 775.  But those were all actual effects of the \nproject itself.  Environmental consequences that may \n(or may not) arise if a project spurs other conduct (i.e., \nother non-environmental consequences) are not \nproximate effects of a project.  The project may be their \nbut-for cause\u2014but if one thing is clear in this context, \n\n39 \nit is that but-for cause is not enough.  The D.C. Circuit \nignored that critical limitation here.4 \nIndeed, the decision below ended up light-years \naway from any recognizable notion of proximate cause.  \nAccording to the court, the \u201cforeseeable environmental \neffects of the project\u201d include \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at new \noil wells that do not yet exist, but that may (or may not) \nbe constructed if the project is approved and it \nincreases demand for waxy crude from the Uinta \nBasin.  Pet.App.66a.  It would be a stretch to argue \nthat 88 miles of rail is the proximate cause of the \nextraction of any fuel, given the myriad factors that go \ninto energy extraction (market demands, emergence of \nnew technology, business expansion and contraction, \njust to name a few).  It would take proximate causation \nwell past its breaking point to try to connect the new \nrail with \u201cthe combustion\u201d of said fuel.  Yet the D.C. \nCircuit went further still, asserting that the new rail \nis the proximate cause of the climate effects of such \ncombustion.  That \u201csounds absurd, because it is.\u201d  \nSekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 738 (2013). \n3. The problems with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nrun deeper still.  NEPA requires consideration only of \n \n4 The regulations in effect at the relevant time here defined \n\u201ceffects\u201d to include both direct and indirect effects, with the latter \nencompassing effects \u201clater in time or farther removed in \ndistance\u201d than the former.  40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.8(a)-(b) (2019).  But \n\u201ceffects\u201d still must be effects of the project itself\u2014and even the \nindirect effects must \u201cstill [be] reasonably foreseeable,\u201d id. \n\u00a71508.8(b), i.e., proximately related to the agency action and \nproject at issue.  To the extent the courts of appeals have \ninterpreted the phrase \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d more broadly, \nthey have misapplied this Court\u2019s decisions. \n\n40 \nproximate effects of proposed projects on the physical \nenvironment, i.e., \u201cthe air, land and water.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772-73 (emphasis removed).  \u201cIf a \nharm does not have a sufficiently close connection to \nthe physical environment, NEPA does not apply.\u201d  Id. \nat 778.  Put simply, what matters is a project\u2019s \nproximate environmental effects; non-environmental \neffects, even if proximate, need not be considered.  The \ndecision \nbelow \ncannot \nbe \nsquared \nwith \nthat \nfundamental limitation on NEPA review. \nTake the risk of downline train accidents.  Even \nassuming that a new, 88-mile railway in rural Utah \nmight be the but-for cause of additional traffic on rail \nlines hundreds of miles distant, which in turn might \neventually contribute to an accident that would not \nhave occurred if the Uinta Basin remained cut off from \nthe national rail system, it does not follow that the \naccident would have any meaningful impact on the \n\u201cair, land and water.\u201d  If the train cars were unloaded \nor carrying innocuous cargo, there would be a safety \nrisk for the Federal Railway Administration to \nconsider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.  \n\u201cNEPA does not require the agency to assess every \nimpact or effect of its proposed action, but only the \nimpact or effect on the environment.\u201d  Id. at 772. \nAt most, then, the D.C. Circuit could only have \nrequired STB to reconsider (the vanishingly narrow \nand remote universe of) downline accidents actually \naffecting the physical environment.  But even limiting \nthe remand to train accidents actually impacting the \nphysical environment does not solve the problem; it \njust highlights that the decision below forces STB to \n\n41 \nevaluate \u201crisk, qua risk.\u201d  See id. at 779.  NEPA \nrequires STB \u201cto prepare an EIS evaluating\u201d harms \nthat are \u201cproximately related to a change in the \nphysical environment.\u201d  Id. at 774.  But the only \nreasonably foreseeable effect of connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the broader national rail system is that \nthere likely will be a very small number of new \naccidents.  That is not an environmental effect at all. \n* * * \nAll told, this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents make clear \nthat the metes and bounds of what an agency must \nanalyze under NEPA should be cabined by what is \nnecessary for the statute to fulfill its important, but \nlimited, mission:  \u201cto promote human welfare by \nalerting governmental actors to the effect of their \nproposed actions on the physical environment.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772.  That makes this case \nstraightforward.  To the extent the proposed project \nhas actual environmental effects that are reasonably \nforeseeable consequences of the project itself, those \neffects must be analyzed (and, as explained, they were \nand then some).  But to the extent the project has non-\nenvironmental effects\u2014ranging from spurring new \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin, to (an infinitesimally \nsmall number of) increased rail accidents downline, to \na change in the quantity or mix of refining activities \non the Gulf Coast\u2014the risk of some environmental \nharm from those activities need not be considered \nunder NEPA.  Thus, in concrete terms, since \napproving the track could cross a critical habitat, \ncontribute to air pollution in the Uinta Basin, or \nchange the topography in a way that causes run-off to \nenter a mountain lake, STB properly studied these \n\n42 \nadverse effects of the project, relying as necessary on \ninput from other agencies, reasonable forecasting, and \neducated assumptions.  But it just as properly \ndeclined to go further to consider risks beyond the \neffect of the proposed action \u201con the physical \nenvironment.\u201d  See id. \nNo one\u2014save, perhaps, project opponents who \nbenefit from delay\u2014would be served by a system \n\u201crequir[ing] detailed discussion of \u2026 effects [that] \ncannot be readily ascertained\u201d in a way that is \n\u201c[in]compatible with the time-frame of the needs to \nwhich the underlying proposal is addressed.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551.  And even if agencies did turn \nover every speculative rock (although there is always \nthe possibility of studying the next-most remote and \nspeculative risk), the resulting EISs would skew \ndecisionmaking by overemphasizing \u201csmall, often \nirrelevant, losses from the proposed new projects,\u201d and \nallowing them to distract from \u201cthe gains [in] \nenvironmental innovation.\u201d  Richard A. Epstein, The \nMany Sins of NEPA, 6 Tex. A&M L. Rev. 1, 3 (2018). \nIn short, \u201c[t]he scope of the agency\u2019s inquiries \nmust remain manageable if NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018ensur[ing] \na fully informed and well considered decision\u2019 is to be \naccomplished.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. \nat 558).  The decision below defies that imperative. \nB. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA\u2019s Rule \nof Reason. \nAs the preceding section explains, the lack of \nproximate cause and actual environmental effects \nfrom the project suffice to explain why STB did not \nneed to consider the three \u201comissions\u201d identified by the \n\n43 \nD.C Circuit.  But STB actually did exercise its \ndiscretion to consider some of these issues in its EIS.  \nFor example, STB used models to predict how many \ntrains would be added to other rail lines, as well as \n\u201cnational data for train accident rates\u201d to predict \nmarginal \nrisks \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \ntrains.  \nPet.App.40a.  The Board likewise employed maps of \nwildfire potential to conclude that the risk of downline \nfires was miniscule.  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s real gripe was not that these effects went \nunstudied, but rather that the court felt that STB \nshould have gone further in its studies.  That is a rule \nof bottomless process, not a rule of reason\u2014and it \ndefies this Court\u2019s precedents.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas, 462 U.S. at 103 (\u201cA reviewing court should not \nmagnify a single line item beyond its significance as \nonly part of a larger Table.\u201d). \nIndeed, when it came to the environmental effects \non communities on the Gulf Coast, the D.C. Circuit \nwent even further and effectively punished STB for \ngoing beyond what NEPA requires.  Given that any \nenvironmental effect on Gulf Coast communities is \nremote and speculative, STB could have simply \ndismissed any such effect as hopelessly remote.  Cf. \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 (rejecting any need to \nconsider psychological effects on far-flung relatives of \nlocal residents).  But STB nonetheless went beyond \nthe call of legal duty to try to trace potential increases \nin waxy crude production to refineries on the Gulf \nCoast, while disclaiming any ability to identify \nparticular refineries.  Applying the no-good-deed-goes-\nunpunished rule of Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat by tracing the waxy crude to Gulf Coast \nrefineries, STB obligated itself to go further and study \n\n44 \nenvironmental effects on Gulf Coast communities and \nthe \nrefineries \ncontribution \nto \nclimate \nchange.  \nPet.App.34a-35a. \nThat approach gets matters almost exactly \nbackwards and defies this Court\u2019s direction to apply a \n\u201cpractical rule of reason\u201d to agency determinations \nand go no further in studying increasingly remote \nenvironmental effects.  Once an EIS analyzes a \nproject\u2019s proximate environmental effects, there is no \nvalid basis for a court to demand more.  The agency \ncan choose to go further, if time and resources allow.  \nBut the agency should not be faulted, let alone \nreversed, for going beyond what is legally required.  \nAnd if the agency concludes that investing additional \nbandwidth into studying a distant or speculative \nenvironmental effect is unlikely to be helpful, then a \ncourt has no \u201cmeaningful standard[]\u201d with which to \nsecond-guess the agency\u2019s judgment.  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 679-80 (2023).  \u201cTo require \notherwise would render agency decisionmaking \nintractable.\u201d  Marsh, 490 U.S. at 373. \nAn agency can deem further study unhelpful for \nany number of reasons.  As in Public Citizen, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when the \nagency lacks the legal \u201cability to prevent\u201d  the studied \neffect.  541 U.S. at 770.  Or, as in Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency might deem further study unhelpful when \nthe agency lacks subject-matter expertise to evaluate \nthe effect:  \u201cTime and resources are simply too \nlimited \u2026 to believe that Congress intended to\u201d \n\u201coblige[]\u201d agencies \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise that is not otherwise relevant \nto their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  460 U.S. \n\n45 \nat 776; see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n729 (2022) (\u201c\u2018When [an] agency has no comparative \nexpertise\u2019 in making certain policy judgments \u2026 \n\u2018Congress presumably would not\u2019 task it with doing \nso.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Kisor v. Wilkie, \n588 U.S. 558, 578 (2019))).  Or, as in Robertson, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when \nanother regulator has primary responsibility for \nremediating \nthe \nstudied \neffect \nin \na \nmore \ncomprehensive fashion.  See 490 U.S. at 340; p.24, \nsupra. \nThese sensible principles laid down by this Court \nexplain why STB was well within its prerogative to \ndecline further study of downline accidents, Gulf \nCoast communities, or \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at yet-\nto-be-built oil wells that may be constructed as a result \nof the new rail.  Pet.App.66a.  At the end of the day, \nSTB is not in a position to regulate rail traffic, track \nsafety, refinery practices, or climate change.  Cf. \nJames W. Coleman, Beyond the Pipeline Wars: \nReforming Environmental Assessment of Energy \nTransport Infrastructure, 2018 Utah L. Rev. 119, 143 \n(2018) (\u201cIn practice, in unpredictably changing energy \nmarkets, it is nearly impossible to predict the \nupstream and downstream impact of a new pipeline \nproject.\u201d).  More to the point, regulation of those issues \nshould focus on ensuring the optimal rules for all track \nsafety and all refinery emissions, not obsessing about \nthe marginal contributions of 88 miles of new track in \nremote, rural Utah.   \nTo be sure, NEPA calls for inter-agency \nconsultation.  But that consultation should be brought \n\n46 \nto bear only on the problems that the proponent \nagency is supposed to study under NEPA.  There is a \nvast difference between consulting with the Forest \nService to determine the effects of a proposed rail \nroute that passes through a National Forest, see, e.g., \nPet.App.182a, and asking EPA to assess how 88 miles \nof additional track in Utah will contribute to climate \nchange based on refining activities on the Gulf Coast.  \nNEPA may require the former, but the rule of reason \nprotects an agency that declines to do the latter. \nThe same logic applies for STB\u2019s reasonable \ndecision to study potential ecological harms from the \nrailway, \nbut \nnot \npotential \nharms \nfrom \nnew \nconstruction that the new line may precipitate.  The \nextent to which one infrastructure project will spur \nsubsequent development is hard enough to predict for \nexperts in real estate or urban planning\u2014and STB is \nneither of those things.  And that is doubly true given \nthat, as even the D.C. Circuit admitted, there is \npresently no way to know with any reasonable degree \nof certainty where exactly in the 12,000-square-mile \nUinta Basin this new development will end up or how \nextensive it will be (if it ends up being built at all).  See \nPet.App.31a-34a. \n \nTo \nthe \nextent \nsome \nnew \ndevelopment materializes, there will be time enough \nfor the appropriate state or federal agencies to perform \ntheir respective statutory mandates to evaluate the \nenvironmental effects of a concrete proposal.  There is \nno need to burden a different agency now with an \nentirely predictive and potentially unnecessary \nhypothetical EIS.   \nSo too for train accidents.  As noted, STB did look \ninto the risks of increased accidents downline, but it \n\n47 \nstopped its NEPA review of the potential risks of \nadditional accidents the new railway could pose after \nconcluding that the risks were de minimis.  See pp.12-\n13, supra.  That is an eminently reasonable approach.  \nRail traffic safety is not a purely (or even \npredominantly) environmental issue.  While train \naccidents, like tanker-truck accidents, have the \npotential to cause environmental problems, the \nprincipal regulatory goal is to minimize all accidents \non the rails, whether cars are full or empty, or whether \nthey carry passengers, wheat, or waxy crude.  And, \nmore to the point, there is a federal agency with \nexpertise, authority, and responsibility for rail safety, \nand it is not STB, but the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (\u201cFRA\u201d), whose Administrator must \nhave \u201cprofessional experience in railroad safety, \nhazardous materials safety, or other transportation \nsafety.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); see p.10, supra.  If \nrespondents think FRA is falling down in its \nmanagement of the national rail system, that is a \nproblem whether or not there are 88 miles of \nadditional track in rural Utah, and they should \nchallenge the relevant FRA agency action.  What they \nshould not be allowed to do is tie the Uinta Basin \nRailway up in court indefinitely by bringing a NEPA \nclaim against STB concerning a de minimis risk. \nThat is especially true given STB\u2019s role in \nadministering a statute that puts a thumb on the scale \nin favor of rail construction.  STB is the successor \nagency to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Its \nmembers must have expertise in transportation and \nbusiness, not oil refining, ecology, or even train safety.  \nIts fundamental duty under 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901 is \n\u201cauthoriz[ing]\u201d rail line \u201cactivities \u2026 []consistent with \n\n48 \nthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d  Id. \u00a710901(c).  \nNeedless to say, any project that contributes to \ninterstate commerce could also be said to contribute to \nclimate change or increased traffic on the national \nrailway system.  While agencies can certainly study \nthe \nenvironmental \nrisks \nfrom \nsuch \nincreased \ncommercial activity, the rule of reason places \nreasonable limits on how much study is necessary and \nprevents NEPA from working at cross-purposes with \nthe basic pro-development mission of agencies like \nSTB. \nAs the decision below illustrates, however, the \nD.C. Circuit has replaced this Court\u2019s rule of reason \nwith a mandate to consider everything under the Sun.  \nIf an agency can block a project on the ground that it \n\u201cwould be too harmful to the environment,\u201d then (says \nthe D.C. Circuit) the agency must consider any and all \ndistant environmental effects the project may (or may \nnot) engender\u2014even if the agency has no role in \nregulating those effects, or the conditions that may \nmitigate or exacerbate them.  Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at \n1373.  So, here, the fact that STB can \u201cdeny\u201d the \npermit required for the rail project \u201con the ground that \nthe railway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other \ncosts outweigh its expected benefits\u201d meant that it \nmust consider \u201cthe climate effects of the combustion of \nthe fuel intended to be extracted\u201d\u2014even though STB \nhas zero authority to do anything about oil extraction, \nfuel combustion, or climate effects.  Pet.App.36a-37a, \n66a.  That is not a rule of reason; it is the opposite. \nThis Court long ago cautioned that NEPA \u201cshould \nnot be\u201d turned into \u201ca game\u201d in which environmental \ngroups and other opponents of progress \u201cengage in \n\n49 \nunjustified obstructionism\u201d by raising a laundry list of \nfar-flung effects that, in their view, \u201c\u2018ought to be\u2019 \nconsidered,\u201d no matter how long it takes and no matter \nwhether the agency doing the considering has any \npower to do anything about the supposed problems the \nproject poses.  Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 553-54.  The \nCourt doubled down on that view in Metropolitan \nEdison, emphasizing that policy disagreements should \nbe aired in \u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA\u201d \nlitigation.  460 U.S. at 777.  It bears emphasis that \nNEPA applies equally to legislative proposals and \nagency projects, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and yet \nlegislative proposals do not come encumbered with \n3,600-page EISs.  The explanation for that difference \nlies in the felt-need of agencies to paper the record in \nthe context of projects that can be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Congress recently made its views on the \npotential misuses and excesses of NEPA crystal clear.  \nSee Part I.B., supra.  Yet, as the decision below makes \nall too clear, the home court of appeals for most of the \nfederal alphabet soup agencies has not gotten the \nmessage.  This Court should set the record straight, \nreverse the decision below, and unshackle agencies \nand infrastructure-development projects from NEPA-\nlitigation purgatory. \nIII. The Court Should Confirm That STB\u2019s EIS \nSatisfies NEPA\u2019s Requirements. \nThis is hardly a case of an agency that \ngreenlighted \na \nproject \nheedless \nof \npotential \nenvironmental impacts.  The EIS here runs to 3,600 \npages.  It took years to prepare, and it reflects \nconsultation with sister agencies with expertise in \nparticular areas.  But all that was not remotely good \n\n50 \nenough for the D.C. Circuit, which demanded more \nspeculation and more exhaustive consideration of \nenvironmental (and non-environmental) risks that are \nremote in both time and geography and that implicate \nissues far outside STB\u2019s narrowly focused mandate.  \nSuch an approach threatens a project that promises to \nbring significant economic development to the Uinta \nBasin by connecting that remote area with the \nnational economy.   \nAnd the threat does not end there.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment demands investment, and investors \ndemand a degree of certainty and assurance that they \nwill not become victims of a regulatory rope-a-dope.  \nOpponents of development know full well that they do \nnot need to win every legal battle to prevail in the war \nof attrition.  The decision below is thus a threat not \njust \nto \nthe \npromising \nproject \nhere, \nbut \nto \ninfrastructure development in general. \nThe best way for this Court to send a clear signal \nthat such NEPA abuse will not be tolerated is to \naffirmatively hold that STB\u2019s EIS here passes NEPA \nmuster.  As the preceding discussion reveals, STB\u2019s \nEIS was comprehensive and thoroughgoing.  It readily \ncleared NEPA\u2019s minimum requirements, since it \nstudied all effects on the physical environment \nproximately caused by approving the railroad.  It even \nwent past proximate cause and discussed some remote \neffects and marginal risks like train accidents and \ndown-rail fires.  But that was gravy, not grounds for \nvacatur and additional study.  Although the court of \nappeals may have preferred that discussion to be more \nthorough, that is not the test.  There is no basis for \nreversing a favorable NEPA determination that \n\n51 \nconsiders all of the proximate environmental effects of \nthe proposed project, and the rule of reason protects \nagencies when they go further and consider some \nmarginal risks without exhaustively examining them \nor running down every rabbit hole.  Simply put, absent \na failure to consider an effect that is both proximate \nand environmental, 3,600 pages of EIS ought to be \nmore than enough. \nIn these circumstances, remanding the EIS to the \nagency \nwould \naccomplish \nnothing \nbut \nsowing \nadditional confusion and delay.  To give both \npetitioners and the people of the Uinta Basin the \ncertainty that they deserve, the Court should reverse \nwith language making clear that STB has no \nobligation to revisit its EIS on remand. \n\n52 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJAY C.

So far, my analysis has likely focused on the petitioner's arguments and the lower court's decision. To form a comprehensive and balanced prediction, it is absolutely essential to understand the respondent's legal arguments, their interpretation of precedent (especially *Dept. of Transportation v. Public Citizen*), and their refutation of the petitioner's claims. The strength and nature of these arguments will drastically change my posterior belief about the case's outcome. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high.\n\nThe Design EIG is moderate. This action represents a fundamental, almost mandatory, step in any SCOTUS case analysis: reading the primary briefs from both sides. While it doesn't uncover a novel strategy, successfully executing this step and observing its high information yield reinforces the importance of this core process. It helps calibrate the priority of retrieving foundational documents in future prediction tasks, confirming that a complete analysis requires a deep dive into both petitioner and respondent arguments before moving to amici or other materials.",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.

And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.

Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J.

Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec.

Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.  Seeking to benefit ranchers, \n\n10 \nfarmers, tribal citizens, and others, the Coalition \nfocused its efforts on rail\u2014a cheaper, safer, and \ncleaner alternative to trucking.  In partnership with \nUinta Basin Railway, LLC, the Coalition sought \napproval from STB to build a new 88-mile rail line \nrunning southwest from the basin to central Utah that \nwould carry diverse commodities to and from the heart \nof \nthe \nbasin \nvia \nthe \nnational \nrail \nnetwork.  \nPet.App.192a. \nThe successor to the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, \nSTB \n\u201cis \nan \nindependent \nfederal \nagency \u2026 charged with the economic regulation of \nvarious modes of surface transportation, primarily \nfreight rail,\u201d but extending to \u201ccertain passenger rail \nmatters, the intercity bus industry, non-energy \npipelines, \nhousehold \ngoods \ncarriers\u2019 \ntariffs, \nand \u2026 non-contiguous domestic water transportation\u201d \nbetween \u201cthe mainland United States, Hawaii, \nAlaska,\u201d and the territories.  Surface Transp. Bd., \nAbout STB, https://bit.ly/3AjwrUO (last visited Aug. \n28, 2024).  As relevant here, Congress made STB \nresponsible for authorizing construction of new \nrailroad lines.  See generally 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901.  \nResponsibility for safety, as distinct from economic, \nregulation of the rails lies elsewhere, in the Federal \nRailroad \nAdministration, \nhoused \nwithin \nthe \nTransportation Department.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin., About FRA, \nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/about-fra \n(last \nvisited Aug. 28, 2024).  Reflecting STB\u2019s relatively \nlimited remit, Congress requires members of the \nBoard to have experience in transportation, economic \nregulation, or business.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a71301(b)(2).   \n\n11 \n2. To help secure financing for the new rail line, \nthe Coalition asked STB to conditionally approve the \nUinta Basin Railway project pending full NEPA \nreview.  Pet.App.204a.  Multiple environmental \ngroups objected, including the Center for Biological \nDiversity, which argued, among other things, that the \nnew rail line would not be financially viable because \n(it said) the basin did not need additional crude-oil \ntransportation \ncapacity. \n \nPet.App.197a. \n \nSTB \nultimately granted conditional approval, but made \nclear that \u201c[c]onstruction may not begin unless and \nuntil the Board issues a final decision\u201d \u201caddressing \nany potential environmental impacts.\u201d  Pet.App.209a.  \nSTB began its NEPA review of the proposed \nrailway in 2019.  Roughly a year and a half later, it \nissued a draft EIS describing the environmental \neffects of three alternative rail alignments and a no-\nbuild alternative.  Pet.App.79a.  STB took the next ten \nmonths to finalize the EIS, reviewing thousands of \ncomments from the public and requesting a report \nfrom the Fish & Wildlife Service about the project\u2019s \nimpact on protected species of fish in the Upper \nColorado River basin.  Pet.App.10a-11a, 50a-51a.  The \nresulting final EIS spanned 3,600 pages and analyzed \nhow \u201cconstruction and operation of the Railway\u201d \nwould impact \u201cwater resources, air quality, special \nstatus species like the greater sage-grouse, land use \nand recreation, local economies, cultural resources, \nand the Ute Indian tribe,\u201d among other things.  \nPet.App.11a; see JA94-105 (EIS table of contents).   \nThe EIS extensively discussed the possibility that \nthe railway might export waxy crude.  \u201cTo the extent \nthat the crude oil would be refined into fuels that \n\n12 \nwould be combusted to produce energy, emissions \nfrom the combustion of the fuels would produce,\u201d \nunder the maximum production scenario, \u201c0.8% of \nnationwide [greenhouse gas] emissions and 0.1% of \nglobal [greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d  Pet.App.106a.  \nThe EIS predicted that roughly half of the oil would be \ndelivered to the Texas Gulf Coast, and another third \nto the Louisiana Gulf Coast, though it could not \n\u201cidentify specific refineries.\u201d  Pet.App.34a, 111a.   \nCloser to the project itself, the EIS estimated the \nnumber of oil wells that would be added in the Basin \ndue to increased oil production enabled by the rail \nproject, while acknowledging that the location of such \n\u201cas yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects\u201d was uncertain.  Pet.App.31a.  The EIS also \nstudied the impact of additional rail traffic on the \nnational rail system, using modeling and historical \ndata to \u201cdetermine[] that the new Railway would lead \nto increased downline traffic, ranging from 0.4 to 9.5 \ntrains per day\u201d and, at most, \u201c0.89 additional \npredicted accidents per year.\u201d  Pet.App.40a.  STB \nultimately concluded that these \u201cminimal increases in \ntrain traffic on existing rail lines over which trains \nalready operate [were] unlikely to cause significant \nimpacts\u201d to vehicle safety and delay, rail safety, noise \nand vibration, air quality, or greenhouse gases.  \nPet.App.110a.   \nIn the end, the EIS concluded that one of the \nalternative rail alignments (the \u201cWhitmore Park \nAlternative\u201d) would \u201cresult in the fewest significant \nimpacts on the environment.\u201d  Pet.App.115a.  The EIS \nalso \nrecommended \nextensive \nenvironmental \n\n13 \nmitigation conditions.  Pet.App.76a; see Pet.App.149a-\n189a.   \nAfter considering the EIS, the Fish & Wildlife \nService\u2019s biological opinion, a separate geological \nstudy evaluating the risk of landslides and other \ngeologic movements, and more, STB issued a final \ndecision approving construction and operation of the \nWhitmore Park Alternative, subject to the mitigation \nrecommendations.  Pet.App.10a-11a.  STB\u2019s final \napproval of the 88-mile railway tracked Congress\u2019 \ndirective in the agency\u2019s organic statute\u2014which \ninstructs STB to approve rail-construction proposals \n\u201cunless [it] finds that such activities are inconsistent \nwith the public convenience and necessity,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n\u00a710901(c); see Mid-States Coal. for Progress v. STB, \n345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) (\u00a710901 creates \u201ca \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved\u201d)\u2014as STB found no basis to conclude from \nthe EIS that any adverse impacts of the new rail line \nwould outweigh the benefits to public convenience and \nnecessity, particularly in light of the extensive \nmitigation requirements the EIS imposed.   \n3. Various environmental groups led by the \nCenter for Biological Diversity sought review of STB\u2019s \ndecision in the D.C. Circuit.  They were joined by \nEagle County, Colorado, which lies hundreds of miles \ndistant from the Uinta Basin, and is significantly \ncloser geographically to Denver than the Utah border.  \nThe court of appeals consolidated the cases and \nallowed Seven County and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC, \nto intervene in defense of STB\u2019s decision.   \nAs relevant here, the Center faulted the EIS for \nnot \u201canalyz[ing] the potential for tens of thousands of \n\n14 \nadditional barrels of oil shipments daily and their \nprocessing in [Gulf Coast] locales to further worsen \npollution burdens.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  The Center likewise \nturned the potential for the railway to spur economic \ndevelopment in a \u201cvast area\u201d against the project, \nflyspecking the EIS for failing to analyze the potential \nfor \u201cwell and road construction, drilling, and truck \ntraffic [to] destroy and degrade habitat.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  \nAnd the Center knocked the EIS for not taking enough \nof \u201ca \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline,\u201d \u201cthe risk and impact of wildfires,\u201d or the \npotential impacts on \u201cthe Colorado River\u201d \u201cgiven the \nincreased rail traffic resulting from the Railway.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a, 46a. \nSTB\u2019s response was straightforward:  Under \nMetropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, it did not \nneed to consider those far-downstream (or down-track) \npotentialities, all of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited \nremit.  STB \u201ccannot regulate or mitigate\u201d any of the \nalleged potential \u201cimpacts\u201d the Center raised.  \nPet.App.31a.  Nor can it accurately predict them.  \n\u201c[A]ny \u2026 development in the Uinta Basin occurring as \na result of the [Railway] will be done in the future as \npart of as yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects that would occur on as yet unidentified \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(second alteration in original).  The amount of new \nconstruction is \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d given the \ninterplay between and among market forces, private \ndecisions, and regulatory actions outside STB\u2019s \ncontrol.  Pet.App.31a.  Likewise, although STB could \nidentify \u201cgeneral geographic regions\u201d where any oil \nmight go to be refined, \u201cthere [wa]s no way to predict \nor assess impacts to specific nearby communities from \n\n15 \nrefining that oil,\u201d because it was impossible to identify \nany one refinery.  Pet.App.31-32a.  And although STB \nestimated that marginal increases in rail traffic could \ncause 0.89 new accidents per year, accidents involving \na loaded crude train would occur far less frequently, \nand the evidence in the record suggested that \nmarginal wildfire risk \u201cwould not be significant.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a-43a, 46a.  \nNone of that was enough for the D.C. Circuit.  The \ndecision below concluded that STB\u2019s \u201cargument that it \nneed not consider effects it cannot prevent is simply \ninapplicable.\u201d  Pet.App.37a.  The court further held \nthat STB \u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could \nnot employ \u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the \naforementioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  \nPet.App.35a.  Invoking its decision in Sabal Trail, the \ncourt found that by taking the trouble to trace \nincreased waxy crude production in rural Utah to \nrefineries on the Gulf Coast, STB had bound itself to \ngo further to analyze the impact of refining activities \non Gulf Coast communities, including contributions to \nclimate \nchange. \n \nPet.App.33a-36a; \nsee \nalso \nPet.App.66a.  The court thus vacated the order and \nremanded for STB to redo the EIS.  Pet.App.70a-71a.1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA imposes a sensible procedural requirement \nthat federal agencies consider a proposed project\u2019s \nenvironmental impact before greenlighting it.  It is not \nsupposed to operate as a substantive obstacle to \n \n1 The D.C. Circuit also remanded for STB to address non-NEPA \nissues and for Fish & Wildlife to address an aspect of its biological \nopinion.  Those non-NEPA issues are not before this Court. \n\n16 \nprojects, requiring agencies to consider remote \npossibilities or empowering project opponents to win a \nwar of attrition by repeatedly forcing agencies to \nconsider just one more possibility.  This Court\u2019s \nprecedents ensure that NEPA strikes a reasonable \nbalance by limiting an agency\u2019s obligations to \nconsidering environmental effects with a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d to the agency\u2019s proposed \naction, and then reviewing the agency\u2019s analysis \nunder NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  The D.C. \nCircuit has lost sight of those limits, as this case \ndramatically illustrates.  STB studied all that NEPA \nrequires and then some in a 3,600-page EIS, but \nenvironmental \nobjectors \nand \nthe \nD.C. \nCircuit \ndemanded still more, including an exhaustive review \nof matters as remote as the impact of additional oil \nrefining (that the new railway theoretically could \nspur) on air quality on the Gulf Coast.  Invoking its \nSabal Trail decision, the D.C. Circuit effectively \npunished STB for going beyond what NEPA requires, \nholding that STB\u2019s efforts to trace increased crude \nproduction to Gulf Coast refineries obligated it to \nstudy environmental effects thousands of miles \nremoved from the project at issue.  There is simply no \nrole under NEPA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s precedents for \nstymying \ndevelopment \nprojects \nbased \non \nenvironmental effects that are so wildly remote in \ngeography and time.  This Court should reaffirm that \nNEPA embodies a demanding form of proximate \ncause, not mere but-for causation, and reverse. \nThis Court has been clear.  \u201cNEPA requires\u201d \nstudying an environmental effect only when there is \n\u201c\u2018a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u2019\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\n17 \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d\u2014\u201cbetween \nthe \nenvironmental \neffect and the alleged cause,\u201d and only when the \nagency \u201chas \u2026 statutory authority over\u201d the \u201ceffect,\u201d \nand thus the \u201cability to prevent\u201d it.  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767, 770 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at \n774).  While the D.C. Circuit cited this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, it required STB\u2019s NEPA analysis to \ntransgress the limits of proximate cause and STB\u2019s \npurview, while giving STB no leeway to make \nreasonable judgments about dim and distant effects. \nThat was legal error.  This Court\u2019s repeated \nemphasis on proximate cause and \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship[s]\u201d between a project and its \nenvironmental effects, Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nrules out the need to consider effects that are far \nremoved in geography and time or that are separated \nby multiple intervening causes that themselves are \nnon-environmental and highly uncertain.  It strains \ncredulity to contend that laying 88 miles of track in \nrural Utah is proximately related to climate change or \nenvironmental harm in Gulf Coast communities.  So \ntoo for potential downline train accidents:  It beggars \nbelief that the legally relevant (i.e., proximate) cause \nof an accident several States away could somehow be \nthe Uinta Basin Railway\u2014and not, for instance, the \nengineer of the relevant train, the train manufacturer, \nor the operator of the relevant track.  Even if the \nproject could be said to be the but-for cause, a tort \nplaintiff suing the agency or the Uinta Basin Railway \nfor a train accident a thousand miles away (let alone \nfor climate change) would be laughed out of court.  The \nresult should be no different just because plaintiffs \nchallenge an EIS under NEPA.  \u201c\u2018[F]or want of a nail, \na kingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \n\n18 \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv\u2019r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nThe decision below also defies NEPA\u2019s \u201cpractical \n\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u201d  N.Y. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. \nKleppe, 97 S.Ct. 4, 6 (1976) (decision of Marshall, J.).  \nNEPA requires agencies to consider proposals \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), not track down \nevery remote or minimal impact.  As one moves from \nthe direct effects of the project to increasingly remote \neffects and mere risks, the agency has discretion to \nignore them or give them more cursory treatment, and \nthe rule of reason prevents a court from forcing an \nagency to consider \u201cinformation\u201d that the agency \ndeems of little \u201cvalue\u201d to the \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374 \n(1989).  For example, whatever the proper solution to \nglobal climate change, the issue must be addressed \nglobally (or at least nationally by EPA), not by \nblocking an 88-mile rail line bringing much-needed \neconomic stability and development to a remote corner \nof Utah.  In practical terms, \u201cno rule of reason worthy \nof that title,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767, would \n\u201coblige\u201d an agency responsible for approving rail \nprojects \n\u201cto \nexpend \nconsiderable \nresources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise\u201d on issues \u201cnot otherwise \nrelevant to [its] congressionally assigned functions,\u201d \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776; see also Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 769.   \nThe decision below is a poster child for converting \na sensible procedural check into a morass that \n\n19 \noperates as a substantive roadblock to development.  \nThe clearest way to put an end to this excess is for this \nCourt to reverse and make clear that the EIS here is \nsufficient.  88 miles of track should not require 3,600 \npages of EIS, let alone a remand for further study of \nwildly remote matters.  This Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nText And Precedent Answer The Question \nPresented In The Negative. \nA. This \nCourt \nHas \nMade \nClear \nThat \nProximate Cause and a Rule of Reason \nSensibly Limit the Scope of NEPA \nReview. \n1. This Court decided Metropolitan Edison in \n1983, four years after a high-profile accident at the \nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant prompted mass \nevacuations and a national reckoning about the safety \nof nuclear power.  Immediately following the accident, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) ordered \nthe power company to shutter the plant indefinitely.  \n460 U.S. at 769.  When the power company sought \npermission to resume operations, the Atomic Energy \nAct required NRC to act as \u201cnecessary or desirable \u2026 \nto protect health or to minimize danger to life or \nproperty.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b).  NEPA also required \nthe Commission to prepare an EIS.  In Metropolitan \nEdison, this Court addressed what environmental \nimpacts NRC needed to consider under NEPA before \nauthorizing Three Mile Island operations to resume. \nThe Court began with statutory text.  Under the \nversion then in effect, NEPA required agencies to \nstudy \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmental effects which \n\n20 \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1975).  As \nthen-Justice Rehnquist explained, this language did \nnot mean that NEPA required the Commission to \nconsider every possible adverse effect of restarting \nThree Mile Island.  460 U.S. at 774.  Rather, \u201cthe \nterms \u2018environmental effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental \nimpact\u2019\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u201d \nakin \nto \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d \u201cbetween\u201d the agency action \u201cand \nthe effect at issue.\u201d  Id.; see also Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 \n(2014) (explaining the settled principle that federal \nstatutes often should be \u201cconstrued \u2026 to incorporate a \nrequirement of proximate causation\u201d). \nWith that statutory construction in hand, the \nCourt unanimously concluded that things like the \n\u201crelease of low-level radiation, increased fog in the \nHarrisburg area (caused by operation of the plant\u2019s \ncooling towers), and the release of warm water into the \nSusquehanna River\u201d were properly on the table for \nNEPA purposes.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775.  \nThese effects, after all, were \u201cproximately related\u201d to \nthe plant resuming operations.  Id. at 774.   \nOn the flip side, the Commission\u2019s EIS did not \nneed to account for \u201cthe potential psychological health \neffects\u201d of reopening the plant on members of the \nsurrounding community, let alone the impact on far-\nflung relatives living hundreds or thousands of miles \naway.  Id. at 771, 774, 777-78.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court did not deny that locals were \nstill reeling from the recent brush with disaster, or \nthat reopening the plant \u201cmay well cause\u201d residents to \n\n21 \nsuffer \n\u201cpsychological \nhealth \nproblems \n\u2026 \nand \naccompanying physical disorders\u201d that derive from \n\u201c\u2018tension and fear.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 774.  But NEPA is \nconcerned with effects of agency action on \u201cthe \nphysical environment\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201c\u2018the air, land and \nwater\u2019\u201d\u2014and such harms were \u201csimply too remote \nfrom the physical environment to justify requiring the \nNRC to evaluate the psychological health damage \u2026 \nthat may be caused by renewed operation of [the \nplant].\u201d  Id. at 773, 774 (emphasis omitted). \nFurthermore, the resumption of operations was \nnot the proximate cause of the health effects \nrespondents raised; those effects instead would \u201cflow \ndirectly from the risk of [a nuclear] accident.\u201d  Id. at \n775 (emphasis added; alteration in original) (quoting \nMetro. Edison Br. for Resps. 23).  \u201cBut a risk of an \naccident is not an effect on the physical environment\u201d \neither.  Id.  \u201cA risk is, by definition, unrealized in the \nphysical world.\u201d  Id. at 767.  What matters under \nNEPA\u2014and what defines the scope of review\u2014is the \nrelationship between the project at issue and changes \nin the physical environment caused by it.  \u201cNEPA does \nnot require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua \nrisk,\u201d of a project moving forward, as opposed to the \nreasonably foreseeable effects of the project itself.  Id. \nat 779.   \nFinally, the Court warned against allowing NEPA \nto be converted into a vehicle for environmental policy \ndisputes.  \u201cThe political process, and not NEPA, \nprovides the appropriate forum in which to air policy \ndisagreements.\u201d  Id. at 777. \nMetropolitan Edison all but resolves this case.  If \nNEPA did not require consideration of allegedly direct \n\n22 \nhealth consequences of the ripped-from-the-headlines \nrisk of another nuclear meltdown before restarting \nThree Mile Island, then it is hard to demand that \nSTB\u2019s EIS here consider the risk of accidents on \nexisting tracks hundreds of miles away, let alone the \nremote and theoretical risk that the Uinta Basin \nRailway could cause future harm to communities near \nGulf Coast refineries.  But if any doubt remained post-\nMetropolitan Edison, Public Citizen settled it. \n2. The question in Public Citizen was whether, \nwhen deciding what safety regulations should govern \nMexican trucks operating in the United States, the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration needed \nto consider the Mexican trucks\u2019 contribution to \ndomestic air pollution.  541 U.S. at 756.  Unlike \nMetropolitan Edison, the question was not risk\u2014e.g., \nthe \nrisk \nthat \nMexican \ntrucks \nwould \nhave \nenvironmentally damaging accidents in the United \nStates or impact traffic patterns in ways that affected \ndistant communities\u2014but the certainty that Mexican \ntrucks would cause additional air pollution.  After all, \nthe regulations were the last thing standing in the \nway of President Bush\u2019s directive to allow Mexican \ntrucks to operate in the United States.  Id. at 765-66.   \nNevertheless, even though the agency action was \nplainly the but-for cause of that increased pollution, \nthe Court concluded that it landed outside NEPA\u2019s \nrequired scope.  Id. at 770.  The Court clarified that \u201ca \n\u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is insufficient to make an \nagency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA \nand the relevant regulations.\u201d  Id. at 767.  Rather, \nNEPA requires agencies to consider only those effects \nproximately caused by the proposed action.  Id.  Given \n\n23 \nthe President\u2019s order, the agency could not simply \ndecline to issue regulations, and so\u2014while the agency \naction allowing the Mexican trucks into the country \nwas plainly a but-for cause of increased pollution\u2014\n\u201cthe President,\u201d \u201cnot\u201d any \u201caction\u201d by the agency, was \n\u201cthe legally relevant cause.\u201d  Id. at 760-61, 769; see \nalso id. at 767 (noting that \u201cproximate cause analysis \nturns on,\u201d among other things, \u201cconsiderations of the \n\u2018legal responsibility\u2019 of actors\u201d (quoting W. Page \nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 275 \n(5th ed. 1984))). \nThe Court likewise invoked NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason,\u201d which ensures that agencies need not engage \nin endless environmental reviews that would frustrate \nthe agency\u2019s primary mission or \u201cserve no purpose in \nlight of NEPA\u2019s regulatory scheme as a whole.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents there argued that while the President\u2019s \ndecision required the agency to allow the trucks into \nthe country, the agency still needed to consider \npollution, on the theory that it might matter on the \nmargins when selecting among the menu of possible \nsafety regulations.  This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would require an \nagency\u201d against its will to study environmental effects \nfalling outside its \u201cability to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 767, 770.   \n3. Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen suffice \nto resolve this case in petitioners\u2019 favor, but they are \nfar from the only decisions of this Court holding that \nonly proximate environmental effects count, and an \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis need not consider remote \nenvironmental effects, non-environmental effects, \npure risk, or matters beyond the agency\u2019s remit. \n\n24 \nIn Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \nfor instance, the Forest Service authorized the \ndevelopment of a major new ski resort in a \u201csparsely \npopulated area\u201d of the Cascade Mountains.  490 U.S. \nat 337.  The resort quickly got bogged down in \nlitigation.  Environmental groups challenged the \nadequacy of the EIS, which recognized that off-site \ndevelopment on private land \u201ccould \u2026 degrad[e] \u2026 \nexisting air quality\u201d but did not delve deeply into the \nair-quality issue.  Id. at 339-40, 344-45.  They further \nargued the EIS needed to conduct a \u201cworst case\u201d \nanalysis of impacts to the local mule-deer population \nand that the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that those \neffects were \u201cuncertain[]\u201d did not suffice.  Id. at 343, \n347.  This Court rejected both arguments with a nod \nto NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Because the county, not \nthe Forest Service, had primary jurisdiction over air \nquality, \u201c[t]he off-site effects on air quality and on the \nmule deer herd\u201d would \u201cbe subject to regulation by \nother \ngovernmental \nbodies\u201d \nwith \nprimary \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the effects and \u201cauthority to \nmitigate them.\u201d  Id. at 350, 352.  \u201c[I]t would be \nincongruous to conclude that the Forest Service\u201d was \nresponsible to develop related mitigation measures.  \nId. at 352-53.2 \n \n2 Unfortunately, that conclusion was not enough to save the \nresort:  Despite heralding the region as \u201cthe best potential \ndestination ski resort in the United States,\u201d Aspen Ski \nCorporation ultimately \u201cbec[a]me weary of the seemingly never-\nending lawsuits\u201d and sold the property to another developer, who \nitself \u201cran out of cash\u201d after \u201cspen[ding] roughly $12 million on \nland and legal fees.\u201d  Ryan Flynn, Early Winters Resort, WA:  A \nSki Hill That Never Was, SnowBrains (Jan. 8, 2024), \n \n\n25 \nThe Court reached a similar conclusion for similar \nreasons in Vermont Yankee.  There, the Court brushed \nback the suggestion that an EIS must \u201cferret out every \npossible\u201d way to mitigate environmental effects, \nparticularly when those effects fall into the domain of \n\u201cstate public utility commissions or similar bodies.\u201d  \n435 U.S. at 550-51, 558.  And in Baltimore Gas and \nElectric, this Court blessed NRC\u2019s use of generic rules \nto evaluate the environmental effects of nuclear power \ngeneration generally, rather than via a power-plant-\nspecific analysis.  As the Court there put it, \u201cCongress \ndid not enact NEPA \u2026 so that an agency would \ncontemplate the environmental impact of an action as \nan abstract exercise\u201d; agencies \u201cha[ve] discretion\u201d \nunder \nNEPA \nto \n\u201ccho[ose]\u201d \nto \n\u201cevaluate \n\u2026 \nenvironmental impact[s]\u201d \u201cgenerically,\u201d rather than \nspecifically, to \u201cfurther[]\u201d \u201c[a]dministrative efficiency \nand consistency of decision.\u201d  462 U.S. at 100-01. \n* * * \nThe lessons of this Court\u2019s NEPA cases are clear, \nyet they all seemed lost on the D.C. Circuit in its \ndecision below.  NEPA requires agencies to study only \nenvironmental effects proximately caused by the \nproposed agency action.  NEPA does not require \nagencies to study remote environmental effects, non-\nenvironmental effects, risks, or factors outside the \nagency\u2019s control.  Nor does an agency have to consider \nevery effect that may (or may not) flow from conduct \nor events that a proposed project may (or may not) \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4fAPp9W.  That result underscores the risk that \nNEPA litigation allows environmental opponents of agency-\napproved projects to lose the NEPA battle while still winning the \nwar of attrition. \n\n26 \nspur, just because the agency could ensure that those \npotential future consequences never arise by denying \na permit and cutting off the proposed action \naltogether.  Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nboth say so directly and confirm that the D.C. Circuit \nerred in requiring STB to consider far-downstream \nconsequences as part of its NEPA review.   \nThat proximate-cause limit tethered to the project \nitself is buttressed by NEPA\u2019s rule of reason, which \nputs sensible limits on what an agency must study.  In \nPublic Citizen, even though pollution from Mexican \ntrucks was a certain, direct environmental effect of the \nFederal \nMotor \nCarrier \nSafety \nAdministration \npromulgating its safety regulations, the agency did \nnot need to study pollution from increased truck \ntraffic, because the agency \u201cha[d] no statutory \nauthority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to \nestablish environmental requirements unrelated to \nmotor carrier safety.\u201d  541 U.S. at 759.  Likewise in \nRobertson, even if air pollution from off-site \ndevelopment was a certain, direct environmental \neffect of licensing the ski resort, the Forest Service \nwould not need to study it, because it would fall within \nthe County\u2019s authority.  Once again, those cases \nconfirm that the D.C. Circuit erred in holding that \nSTB must conduct a full-scale NEPA review of issues \nfar outside its limited remit, but well within the \npurview of other agencies\u2019 authority\u2014especially when \nthose other agencies can address such issues more \ncomprehensively, rather than making a relatively \nmodest infrastructure project the scapegoat for \neverything from upstream mining to downstream \naccident risks and climate change. \n\n27 \nB. The \nBUILDER \nAct \nButtresses \nthe \nLimitations on NEPA Review That This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Recognize and Enforce. \nThis Court has long \u201capplied the standard \nrequirement of proximate cause to actions under \nfederal statutes\u201d even though \u201cthe text did not \nexpressly provide for it.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nMcBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting).  As of 2023, NEPA\u2019s text does provide for \nit.  While not directly applicable to this pre-Act project, \nCongress codified in the BUILDER Act what this \nCourt has long held, making clear that the scope of \nNEPA \nreview \nturns \non \nforeseeability \nand \nreasonableness\u2014i.e., proximate cause\u2014and that \nNEPA does not alter statutory provisions delimiting \nan agency\u2019s authority or mission. \nAs amended by the BUILDER Act, NEPA now \nprovides as follows: \n(2) [A]ll agencies of the Federal Government \nshall\u2014 \n(C) \u2026 except where compliance would be \ninconsistent \nwith \nother \nstatutory \nrequirements, \ninclude \nin \nevery \nrecommendation or report on proposals for \nlegislation and other major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on\u2014 \n(i) \nthe \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nenvironmental impact effects of the \nproposed agency action,; \n\n28 \n(ii) \nany \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal be implemented,; [and] \n(iii) \na \nreasonable \nrange \nof \nalternatives to the proposed agency \naction, including an analysis of any \nnegative environmental impacts of \nnot \nimplementing \nthe \nproposed \nagency action in the case of a no \naction \nalternative, \nthat \nare \ntechnically \nand \neconomically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposal[.]  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332 (2023) (additions underlined; \ndeletions stricken). \nThese \nclarifying \nchanges \nunderscore \nthat \nCongress has embraced this Court\u2019s decisions, which \nkeep NEPA as a manageable procedural check, rather \nthan a substantive roadblock to infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The BUILDER Act makes explicit what \nthis Court already held was implicit by textually \nadopting the language of proximate cause.  See, e.g., \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) \n(proximate cause is \u201coften explicated in terms of \nforeseeability\u201d).  That strongly reinforces this Court\u2019s \ndecisions.  After all, if Congress can \u201ccarry forward\u201d \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nstatutory \nprecedents \nmerely \nby \n\u201cperpetuating the [same] wording\u201d (i.e., doing nothing \nin response to this Court\u2019s statutory decisions), then \nCongress\u2019 affirmative choice to adopt new language \nembracing prior statutory precedents of this Court \nsupplies a strong signal that those precedents were \n\n29 \ncorrect.  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \nThe BUILDER Act likewise embraces the rule of \nreason recognized in Public Citizen.  The Act\u2019s title \nunderscores Congress\u2019 intent for NEPA review to be \nnarrow and efficient, rather than unwieldy and anti-\ndevelopment.  See id. at 221 (noting that statutory \ntitles provide a \u201cpermissible indicator[] of meaning\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the Act continues to limit NEPA to projects \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and it now \nexpressly \nabsolves \nagencies \nof \nconsidering \nalternatives \nthat \nare \nnot \n\u201creasonable,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) (2023), and presumptively limits the \nEIS process to no more than \u201c2 years\u201d and an EIS itself \nto \u201c150 pages,\u201d id. \u00a74336a(e)(1), (g)(1).  What is more, \nit makes explicit that when Congress assigns an \nagency to administer a decidedly pro-development \nstatute\u2014as \nit \nhas \ndone \nwith \nSTB \nand \nrail \nconstruction, see p.10, supra\u2014NEPA does not stand in \nthe way; the agency need only weigh alternatives that \n\u201cmeet the purpose and need of the proposal\u201d and \nevaluate the cost of doing nothing.  Id. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) \n(2023).   \nAt bottom, the BUILDER Act not only endorses \nthis Court\u2019s focus on proximate cause and underscores \nthat limits on an agency\u2019s regulatory mission and its \nsubject-matter portfolio are baked into the rule of \nreason, but illustrates the folly in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nboil-the-ocean mandate here. \n\n30 \nII. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA And This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Applying It.   \nThis Court\u2019s NEPA precedents and Congress\u2019 \nrecent and emphatic reaffirmation of them confirm \nthat NEPA envisions a procedural cross-check, not a \nsubstantive roadblock.  And NEPA\u2019s procedural cross-\ncheck is not designed to be unduly onerous or to \nresemble a Sisyphean task, where there is always one \nadditional and increasingly remote effect or risk that \nmust be considered.  To the contrary, NEPA strikes a \nsensible balance where an agency need only consider \nproximate environmental effects and judgments about \nwhat to consider are protected from endless second-\nguessing by a rule of reason.  Striking this balance \nensures that NEPA will continue to facilitate \u201cfully \ninformed and well-considered decision[s]\u201d while \nremaining \u201cbounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551, 558.  It likewise ensures that \n\u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA, provides the \nappropriate \nforum \nin \nwhich \nto \nair \npolicy \ndisagreements\u201d with a project that meets all the \nsubstantive criteria for agency approval.  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 777. \nThe decision below upsets that balance and \nthreatens to block vital infrastructure development \nunder the guise of just a little more process.  The \nimpact (if any) of 88 new miles of track in an isolated \ncorner of Utah on train accidents hundreds of miles \naway or the air quality of refining communities on the \nGulf Coast or on climate change is the very definition \nof remote, not proximate, cause.  And despite the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s view that NEPA demands a never-ending \nprocess, it was eminently reasonable for an agency \n\n31 \nresponsible for administering an explicitly pro-\ndevelopment statute to decline to consider de minimis \nenvironmental impacts that are little more than the \ninevitable consequences of development and that \nshould be regulated (if at all) as part of a \ncomprehensive scheme administered by a different \nagency.  To state the obvious, the solution to the global \nissue of climate change does not lie in blocking 88 \nmiles of track or keeping the Uinta Basin isolated from \nthe national economy.   \nA. The \nDecision \nBelow \nDemanded \nConsideration of Non-Proximate and \nNon-Environmental Effects. \n1. If a train collision occurs in the middle of \nColorado and winds up in court, there are plenty of \npotential tort defendants:  the hapless train engineer, \nthe careless builder of the malfunctioning train, the \nmanufacturer of the unsafe track, the negligent \ndispatcher who was on duty, or perhaps even the \nreckless safety regulator who ignored advice to lower \nthe relevant speed limit.  Only the most creative of \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2014and least successful, given the \nwell-established limits of proximate cause\u2014would \nthink to sue the operator of an 88-mile rail line that \nbegins and ends in rural Utah or the regulator who \napproved it on the theory that it increased downline \naccident risk by less than a percentage point. \nThat would be true a fortiori for consequences on \nthe ground (or in the air above it) from increased waxy \ncrude refining on the Gulf Coast\u2014and doubly so of \neffects of such refining on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as \nchanges or increases in refining are strictly regulated \nby other agencies.  Not even Helen Palsgraf could have \n\n32 \ndreamed of a judicial opinion finding 88 miles of track \nwholly in rural Utah to be the proximate cause of \nfuture air pollution on the Gulf Coast and its \nramifications for Gulf refining communities\u2014to say \nnothing of one linking the railway to monsoons in the \nSouth Pacific.   \nWhile well-established principles of proximate \ncause would stop such fanciful lawsuits at the starting \ngate, the D.C. Circuit put STB on the hook for \nstudying similarly remote effects of approving 88 \nmiles of rail line in rural Utah.  The D.C. Circuit \njustified that burden not by expressly finding air \npollution on the Gulf Coast or downline accidents to be \nproximately caused by the project, but by emphasizing \nthat STB has the authority to deny the permit \nnecessary for the project if it \u201cfinds that such activities \nare inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d  See Pet.App.36a-37a; 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901(c). \nThat analytical leap hopelessly conflates but-for \nand proximate cause.  An agency can avoid any \nnumber of remote impacts and risks of harmful \nactivity by denying a required permit, because the \nvery nature of a permit makes it a necessary but-for \ncause of the permitted activity.  But this Court has \nrepeatedly rejected the notion that NEPA embodies \nsuch a \u201c\u2018but-for\u2019 causation\u201d standard.  Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 767.  In its place, and in order to protect \nthe \u201cmanageable\u201d and balanced approach that \nCongress intended, see Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776, \nNEPA requires agencies to study only proximate \nenvironmental effects.  In light of \u201cthe congressional \nconcerns that led to the enactment of NEPA,\u201d \u201c[s]ome \neffects\u201d of a proposed project \u201cthat are \u2018caused by\u2019 a \n\n33 \nchange in the physical environment in the sense of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation, will nonetheless not fall within [NEPA] \nbecause the causal chain is too attenuated.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nStated more succinctly, proximate cause is the \ntouchstone for an EIS\u2014and where proximate cause \nends, so ends the scope of what NEPA requires.   \nMoreover, as this Court has emphasized, the focus \nof the proximate-cause inquiry is on the project itself, \nnot on subsequent activities a project may someday \nenable.  See id. at 771-79; pp.20-21, supra.  NEPA \nrequires \u201ca detailed statement\u201d of \u201cthe environmental \nimpact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2019) \n(emphases added).3  Thus, \u201cto decide what kind of an \n[EIS] need be prepared, it is necessary first to describe \naccurately the \u2026 \u2018action\u2019 being taken.\u201d  Aberdeen & \nRockfish R.R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U.S. 289, 322 (1975); \nsee also Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 395-402 \n(1976).  And the same is true for the proximate-cause \ninquiry.  \u201cTo determine whether [NEPA] requires \nconsideration of a particular effect, we must look at \nthe relationship between that effect and the change in \nthe physical environment caused by the major federal \naction at issue.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773 \n(emphasis added).  What matters, in other words, is \nthe relationship between the project and changes in \nthe physical environment caused by it.  \n \n3 The language under the BUILDER Act is substantially \nsimilar.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2023) (requiring \u201ca detailed \nstatement\u201d of, inter alia, \u201creasonably foreseeable environmental \neffects of the proposed agency action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed agency action\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnder that rubric, changes in the physical \nenvironment that have a reasonably close causal \nrelationship to a proposed project must be considered \nas part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review.  But changes in \nthe physical environment that are remote from a \nproposed project in space and time need not be \nconsidered as part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review, \nbecause \nthose \neffects \nare, \nby \ndefinition, \nnot \nproximately caused by the project.  Likewise, \nenvironmental effects that flow from subsequent \nactions that the project may (or may not) ultimately \nenable need not be considered under NEPA, as such \nuncertain potentialities likewise lie well beyond the \nscope of proximate environmental effects. \nThat sensible proximate-cause limit focused on \nthe project itself is reinforced by NEPA\u2019s direction to \nconsider alternatives.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii).  \nIt makes perfect sense for an agency to consider three \nalternative rail routes to connect the Uinta Basin with \nthe national rail system, as well as a no-action \nalternative.  See pp.11-13, supra.  If one route \nendangers important habitat or threatens a pristine \nriver, then the EIS helpfully directs the agency to an \nalternative.  But it is completely infeasible to consider \nevery alternative for the cargo that could be carried on \ndistant rail lines, the development the rail line could \nprecipitate in the Uinta Basin, or the permutations for \nthe mix and quantity of crude refined on the Gulf \nCoast.  And NEPA directs agencies to consider all \nalternatives in the same manner, not to go to the ends \nof the Earth vis-\u00e0-vis the principal proposal and give \nonly cursory consideration to the alternatives.  Thus, \nthe only conclusion consistent with NEPA\u2019s text and \nthe imperative to keep NEPA analysis within \n\n35 \nreasonable bounds is to consider only a manageable \nrange of proximate environmental effects of all \nalternatives.  Any other conclusion would leave \nagencies (and courts) with impossible burdens and \nwithout \u201ca manageable line between those causal \nchanges that may make an actor responsible for an \neffect and those that do not.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7). \n2. The D.C. Circuit lost sight of these important \nprinciples here.  The court of appeals perceived three \nfailings in the EIS:  failing to adequately consider \n(1) \u201cthe effects of increased crude oil refining on Gulf \nCoast \ncommunities \nin \nLouisiana \nand \nTexas\u201d; \n(2) \u201cdownline effects of projected increases in spills \nand accidents from additional oil trains traveling the \nexisting Union Pacific rail line\u201d; and (3) the \u201cupline \nimpacts on vegetation or special status species\u201d that \nmight be found near potential well sites if the new \nrailway \nspurs \nindependent \ndevelopment.  \nPet.App.12a-13a; see also Pet.App.30a-37a, 40a-47a.   \nJust quoting those supposedly \u201comitted\u201d impacts \nconfirms that the D.C. Circuit went well beyond \nproximate environmental effects of adding 88 miles of \nrail in rural Utah.  First, any impact on Gulf Coast \ncommunities in Louisiana and Texas is wildly remote \nin multiple dimensions.  There are multiple States, \nand more than a thousand miles, between the 88 miles \nof track in Utah and the Gulf Coast.   \nAnd there is arguably an even greater gap \nbetween the project and any material increase in \ncrude oil refining in those remote areas.  Even \ncrediting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s apparent assumption that \nall crude shipped on a common-carrier rail line will \n\n36 \nend up at a specific destination in the Gulf Coast, \nwhether there will even be an increase in crude oil \nrefining on the Gulf Coast depends on the amount of \nwaxy crude shipped on the new line and how that \ncompares to the status quo ante with truck \ntransportation, see CADCJA230, \u201cthe ability and \nwillingness\u201d of the refineries in those areas to receive \nand process waxy crude oil, JA477, and (among many \nother things) the actions of myriad local, state, and \nfederal regulators who already directly oversee the \nrefineries\u2019 operations.  Figuring out \u201cthe climate \neffects of the combustion of the fuel intended to be \nextracted\u201d thus depends on guessing which part (or \nparts) of the Gulf Coast might receive and refine the \noil; speculating whether and to what degree waxy \ncrude from the Uinta Basin will augment existing \nrefining activity, rather than just displace refining \ncrude from elsewhere (and, if so, what kind of crude is \ndisplaced); estimating the relative impacts of refining \none form of crude versus another; and then inferring \nthat the environmental protections already in place \n(due to action by EPA and state regulators, not STB) \nwould fail to protect the surrounding community from \nany marginal increase in refining output.  All of those \nare \u201cmiddle links\u201d that render \u201cthe effects of increased \ncrude oil refining on Gulf Coast communities in \nLouisiana and Texas\u201d far too remote from a new \nrailway line in rural Utah and far too speculative to \njustify NEPA review of those highly contingent \npotentialities.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775. \nThe \u201cdownline\u201d effects of STB\u2019s decision are, if \nanything, even more contingent and remote.  As part \nof its NEPA review, STB used models to predict how \nmany trains would be added to other rail lines.  Based \n\n37 \non that prediction, STB estimated that the additional \ntrain cars would result in less than one\u20140.89, to be \nexact\u2014additional \ntrain \naccident \neach \nyear.  \nPet.App.40a-41a.  And even that number oversells the \npoint.  Where such an accident would occur; whether \nit would be serious or minor; whether it would involve \ncars that were empty or full; and whether it would \ncause any damage to the physical environment \nhundreds or thousands of miles removed from the \nUinta Basin are all matters of complete guesswork.  As \nnoted, any plaintiff trying to sue the operators of the \n88 miles of rural Utah track (or STB) for a train \naccident in Colorado, Louisiana, or anywhere in \nbetween would be laughed out of court.  The most that \ncould be said is that STB approval of the 88 miles at \nissue here was a but-for cause of the future accident.  \nTo argue that the accident was a proximate \nenvironmental effect drains those words of meaning \nand defies this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThe same is true of the potential that, if the \nrailway spurs new development in the Uinta Basin, \nthat new development may have effects on the \nsurrounding environs.  See Pet.App.31a.  Initially, \nthat risk depends on the assumption that the new rail \nline will carry substantial amounts of waxy crude\u2014by \nno means a certainty, as evidenced by the fact that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity previously contended \nthat market demand for oil could never sustain the \nrailway. \n \nSee \nPet.App.197a-198a. \n \nAnd \nthe \nassumptions spin out from there.  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nown \ndescription \nof \nSTB\u2019s \nsupposed \nomissions \nunderscores that it has gone well beyond proximate \nenvironmental effects of the project itself.  The D.C. \nCircuit demanded consideration of \u201cas yet unknown \n\n38 \nand unplanned independent projects that would occur \non as yet unidentified private, state, tribal, or federal \nland,\u201d \u201cundertaken \u2018by as yet unknown entities and \nlicensed or permitted by other federal agencies, state \nand local governments, or the Ute Tribe, depending on \nthe location of the development,\u2019\u201d at a level that is \n\u201csimply unknown and unknowable.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(quoting CADC.Gov.Br.35-36).  The court should have \nstopped well before the fourth \u201cunknown.\u201d  None of \nthose unknowns is a proximate consequence of the \nproject, as opposed to a potential consequence of \nindependent development that the project may (or \nmay not) spur and that could pose some harm to the \nenvironment, \ndespite \nwhatever \nenvironmental \nanalysis is required if, and when, any concrete future \nprojects materialize. \nTo be sure, an agency must make some educated \nassumptions about environmental effects that are \ncertain but hard to quantify, to \u201censure[] that [those] \nimportant \neffects \nwill \nnot \nbe \noverlooked \nor \nunderestimated,\u201d and to \u201cprovide[] a springboard for \npublic comment.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.  In \nMetropolitan Edison, for example, NRC needed to \nmake educated assumptions about the \u201crelease of low-\nlevel radiation, increased fog in the [surrounding] area \n(caused by operation of the plant\u2019s cooling towers), and \nthe release of warm water into [a nearby] River.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 775.  But those were all actual effects of the \nproject itself.  Environmental consequences that may \n(or may not) arise if a project spurs other conduct (i.e., \nother non-environmental consequences) are not \nproximate effects of a project.  The project may be their \nbut-for cause\u2014but if one thing is clear in this context, \n\n39 \nit is that but-for cause is not enough.  The D.C. Circuit \nignored that critical limitation here.4 \nIndeed, the decision below ended up light-years \naway from any recognizable notion of proximate cause.  \nAccording to the court, the \u201cforeseeable environmental \neffects of the project\u201d include \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at new \noil wells that do not yet exist, but that may (or may not) \nbe constructed if the project is approved and it \nincreases demand for waxy crude from the Uinta \nBasin.  Pet.App.66a.  It would be a stretch to argue \nthat 88 miles of rail is the proximate cause of the \nextraction of any fuel, given the myriad factors that go \ninto energy extraction (market demands, emergence of \nnew technology, business expansion and contraction, \njust to name a few).  It would take proximate causation \nwell past its breaking point to try to connect the new \nrail with \u201cthe combustion\u201d of said fuel.  Yet the D.C. \nCircuit went further still, asserting that the new rail \nis the proximate cause of the climate effects of such \ncombustion.  That \u201csounds absurd, because it is.\u201d  \nSekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 738 (2013). \n3. The problems with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nrun deeper still.  NEPA requires consideration only of \n \n4 The regulations in effect at the relevant time here defined \n\u201ceffects\u201d to include both direct and indirect effects, with the latter \nencompassing effects \u201clater in time or farther removed in \ndistance\u201d than the former.  40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.8(a)-(b) (2019).  But \n\u201ceffects\u201d still must be effects of the project itself\u2014and even the \nindirect effects must \u201cstill [be] reasonably foreseeable,\u201d id. \n\u00a71508.8(b), i.e., proximately related to the agency action and \nproject at issue.  To the extent the courts of appeals have \ninterpreted the phrase \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d more broadly, \nthey have misapplied this Court\u2019s decisions. \n\n40 \nproximate effects of proposed projects on the physical \nenvironment, i.e., \u201cthe air, land and water.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772-73 (emphasis removed).  \u201cIf a \nharm does not have a sufficiently close connection to \nthe physical environment, NEPA does not apply.\u201d  Id. \nat 778.  Put simply, what matters is a project\u2019s \nproximate environmental effects; non-environmental \neffects, even if proximate, need not be considered.  The \ndecision \nbelow \ncannot \nbe \nsquared \nwith \nthat \nfundamental limitation on NEPA review. \nTake the risk of downline train accidents.  Even \nassuming that a new, 88-mile railway in rural Utah \nmight be the but-for cause of additional traffic on rail \nlines hundreds of miles distant, which in turn might \neventually contribute to an accident that would not \nhave occurred if the Uinta Basin remained cut off from \nthe national rail system, it does not follow that the \naccident would have any meaningful impact on the \n\u201cair, land and water.\u201d  If the train cars were unloaded \nor carrying innocuous cargo, there would be a safety \nrisk for the Federal Railway Administration to \nconsider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.  \n\u201cNEPA does not require the agency to assess every \nimpact or effect of its proposed action, but only the \nimpact or effect on the environment.\u201d  Id. at 772. \nAt most, then, the D.C. Circuit could only have \nrequired STB to reconsider (the vanishingly narrow \nand remote universe of) downline accidents actually \naffecting the physical environment.  But even limiting \nthe remand to train accidents actually impacting the \nphysical environment does not solve the problem; it \njust highlights that the decision below forces STB to \n\n41 \nevaluate \u201crisk, qua risk.\u201d  See id. at 779.  NEPA \nrequires STB \u201cto prepare an EIS evaluating\u201d harms \nthat are \u201cproximately related to a change in the \nphysical environment.\u201d  Id. at 774.  But the only \nreasonably foreseeable effect of connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the broader national rail system is that \nthere likely will be a very small number of new \naccidents.  That is not an environmental effect at all. \n* * * \nAll told, this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents make clear \nthat the metes and bounds of what an agency must \nanalyze under NEPA should be cabined by what is \nnecessary for the statute to fulfill its important, but \nlimited, mission:  \u201cto promote human welfare by \nalerting governmental actors to the effect of their \nproposed actions on the physical environment.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772.  That makes this case \nstraightforward.  To the extent the proposed project \nhas actual environmental effects that are reasonably \nforeseeable consequences of the project itself, those \neffects must be analyzed (and, as explained, they were \nand then some).  But to the extent the project has non-\nenvironmental effects\u2014ranging from spurring new \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin, to (an infinitesimally \nsmall number of) increased rail accidents downline, to \na change in the quantity or mix of refining activities \non the Gulf Coast\u2014the risk of some environmental \nharm from those activities need not be considered \nunder NEPA.  Thus, in concrete terms, since \napproving the track could cross a critical habitat, \ncontribute to air pollution in the Uinta Basin, or \nchange the topography in a way that causes run-off to \nenter a mountain lake, STB properly studied these \n\n42 \nadverse effects of the project, relying as necessary on \ninput from other agencies, reasonable forecasting, and \neducated assumptions.  But it just as properly \ndeclined to go further to consider risks beyond the \neffect of the proposed action \u201con the physical \nenvironment.\u201d  See id. \nNo one\u2014save, perhaps, project opponents who \nbenefit from delay\u2014would be served by a system \n\u201crequir[ing] detailed discussion of \u2026 effects [that] \ncannot be readily ascertained\u201d in a way that is \n\u201c[in]compatible with the time-frame of the needs to \nwhich the underlying proposal is addressed.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551.  And even if agencies did turn \nover every speculative rock (although there is always \nthe possibility of studying the next-most remote and \nspeculative risk), the resulting EISs would skew \ndecisionmaking by overemphasizing \u201csmall, often \nirrelevant, losses from the proposed new projects,\u201d and \nallowing them to distract from \u201cthe gains [in] \nenvironmental innovation.\u201d  Richard A. Epstein, The \nMany Sins of NEPA, 6 Tex. A&M L. Rev. 1, 3 (2018). \nIn short, \u201c[t]he scope of the agency\u2019s inquiries \nmust remain manageable if NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018ensur[ing] \na fully informed and well considered decision\u2019 is to be \naccomplished.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. \nat 558).  The decision below defies that imperative. \nB. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA\u2019s Rule \nof Reason. \nAs the preceding section explains, the lack of \nproximate cause and actual environmental effects \nfrom the project suffice to explain why STB did not \nneed to consider the three \u201comissions\u201d identified by the \n\n43 \nD.C Circuit.  But STB actually did exercise its \ndiscretion to consider some of these issues in its EIS.  \nFor example, STB used models to predict how many \ntrains would be added to other rail lines, as well as \n\u201cnational data for train accident rates\u201d to predict \nmarginal \nrisks \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \ntrains.  \nPet.App.40a.  The Board likewise employed maps of \nwildfire potential to conclude that the risk of downline \nfires was miniscule.  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s real gripe was not that these effects went \nunstudied, but rather that the court felt that STB \nshould have gone further in its studies.  That is a rule \nof bottomless process, not a rule of reason\u2014and it \ndefies this Court\u2019s precedents.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas, 462 U.S. at 103 (\u201cA reviewing court should not \nmagnify a single line item beyond its significance as \nonly part of a larger Table.\u201d). \nIndeed, when it came to the environmental effects \non communities on the Gulf Coast, the D.C. Circuit \nwent even further and effectively punished STB for \ngoing beyond what NEPA requires.  Given that any \nenvironmental effect on Gulf Coast communities is \nremote and speculative, STB could have simply \ndismissed any such effect as hopelessly remote.  Cf. \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 (rejecting any need to \nconsider psychological effects on far-flung relatives of \nlocal residents).  But STB nonetheless went beyond \nthe call of legal duty to try to trace potential increases \nin waxy crude production to refineries on the Gulf \nCoast, while disclaiming any ability to identify \nparticular refineries.  Applying the no-good-deed-goes-\nunpunished rule of Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat by tracing the waxy crude to Gulf Coast \nrefineries, STB obligated itself to go further and study \n\n44 \nenvironmental effects on Gulf Coast communities and \nthe \nrefineries \ncontribution \nto \nclimate \nchange.  \nPet.App.34a-35a. \nThat approach gets matters almost exactly \nbackwards and defies this Court\u2019s direction to apply a \n\u201cpractical rule of reason\u201d to agency determinations \nand go no further in studying increasingly remote \nenvironmental effects.  Once an EIS analyzes a \nproject\u2019s proximate environmental effects, there is no \nvalid basis for a court to demand more.  The agency \ncan choose to go further, if time and resources allow.  \nBut the agency should not be faulted, let alone \nreversed, for going beyond what is legally required.  \nAnd if the agency concludes that investing additional \nbandwidth into studying a distant or speculative \nenvironmental effect is unlikely to be helpful, then a \ncourt has no \u201cmeaningful standard[]\u201d with which to \nsecond-guess the agency\u2019s judgment.  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 679-80 (2023).  \u201cTo require \notherwise would render agency decisionmaking \nintractable.\u201d  Marsh, 490 U.S. at 373. \nAn agency can deem further study unhelpful for \nany number of reasons.  As in Public Citizen, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when the \nagency lacks the legal \u201cability to prevent\u201d  the studied \neffect.  541 U.S. at 770.  Or, as in Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency might deem further study unhelpful when \nthe agency lacks subject-matter expertise to evaluate \nthe effect:  \u201cTime and resources are simply too \nlimited \u2026 to believe that Congress intended to\u201d \n\u201coblige[]\u201d agencies \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise that is not otherwise relevant \nto their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  460 U.S. \n\n45 \nat 776; see also West Virginia v.

Wilkie, \n588 U.S. 558, 578 (2019))).  Or, as in Robertson, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when \nanother regulator has primary responsibility for \nremediating \nthe \nstudied \neffect \nin \na \nmore \ncomprehensive fashion.  See 490 U.S. at 340; p.24, \nsupra. \nThese sensible principles laid down by this Court \nexplain why STB was well within its prerogative to \ndecline further study of downline accidents, Gulf \nCoast communities, or \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at yet-\nto-be-built oil wells that may be constructed as a result \nof the new rail.  Pet.App.66a.  At the end of the day, \nSTB is not in a position to regulate rail traffic, track \nsafety, refinery practices, or climate change.  Cf. \nJames W. Coleman, Beyond the Pipeline Wars: \nReforming Environmental Assessment of Energy \nTransport Infrastructure, 2018 Utah L. Rev. 119, 143 \n(2018) (\u201cIn practice, in unpredictably changing energy \nmarkets, it is nearly impossible to predict the \nupstream and downstream impact of a new pipeline \nproject.\u201d).  More to the point, regulation of those issues \nshould focus on ensuring the optimal rules for all track \nsafety and all refinery emissions, not obsessing about \nthe marginal contributions of 88 miles of new track in \nremote, rural Utah.   \nTo be sure, NEPA calls for inter-agency \nconsultation.  But that consultation should be brought \n\n46 \nto bear only on the problems that the proponent \nagency is supposed to study under NEPA.  There is a \nvast difference between consulting with the Forest \nService to determine the effects of a proposed rail \nroute that passes through a National Forest, see, e.g., \nPet.App.182a, and asking EPA to assess how 88 miles \nof additional track in Utah will contribute to climate \nchange based on refining activities on the Gulf Coast.  \nNEPA may require the former, but the rule of reason \nprotects an agency that declines to do the latter. \nThe same logic applies for STB\u2019s reasonable \ndecision to study potential ecological harms from the \nrailway, \nbut \nnot \npotential \nharms \nfrom \nnew \nconstruction that the new line may precipitate.  The \nextent to which one infrastructure project will spur \nsubsequent development is hard enough to predict for \nexperts in real estate or urban planning\u2014and STB is \nneither of those things.  And that is doubly true given \nthat, as even the D.C. Circuit admitted, there is \npresently no way to know with any reasonable degree \nof certainty where exactly in the 12,000-square-mile \nUinta Basin this new development will end up or how \nextensive it will be (if it ends up being built at all).  See \nPet.App.31a-34a. \n \nTo \nthe \nextent \nsome \nnew \ndevelopment materializes, there will be time enough \nfor the appropriate state or federal agencies to perform \ntheir respective statutory mandates to evaluate the \nenvironmental effects of a concrete proposal.  There is \nno need to burden a different agency now with an \nentirely predictive and potentially unnecessary \nhypothetical EIS.   \nSo too for train accidents.  As noted, STB did look \ninto the risks of increased accidents downline, but it \n\n47 \nstopped its NEPA review of the potential risks of \nadditional accidents the new railway could pose after \nconcluding that the risks were de minimis.  See pp.12-\n13, supra.  That is an eminently reasonable approach.  \nRail traffic safety is not a purely (or even \npredominantly) environmental issue.  While train \naccidents, like tanker-truck accidents, have the \npotential to cause environmental problems, the \nprincipal regulatory goal is to minimize all accidents \non the rails, whether cars are full or empty, or whether \nthey carry passengers, wheat, or waxy crude.  And, \nmore to the point, there is a federal agency with \nexpertise, authority, and responsibility for rail safety, \nand it is not STB, but the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (\u201cFRA\u201d), whose Administrator must \nhave \u201cprofessional experience in railroad safety, \nhazardous materials safety, or other transportation \nsafety.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); see p.10, supra.  If \nrespondents think FRA is falling down in its \nmanagement of the national rail system, that is a \nproblem whether or not there are 88 miles of \nadditional track in rural Utah, and they should \nchallenge the relevant FRA agency action.  What they \nshould not be allowed to do is tie the Uinta Basin \nRailway up in court indefinitely by bringing a NEPA \nclaim against STB concerning a de minimis risk. \nThat is especially true given STB\u2019s role in \nadministering a statute that puts a thumb on the scale \nin favor of rail construction.  STB is the successor \nagency to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Its \nmembers must have expertise in transportation and \nbusiness, not oil refining, ecology, or even train safety.  \nIts fundamental duty under 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901 is \n\u201cauthoriz[ing]\u201d rail line \u201cactivities \u2026 []consistent with \n\n48 \nthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d  Id. \u00a710901(c).  \nNeedless to say, any project that contributes to \ninterstate commerce could also be said to contribute to \nclimate change or increased traffic on the national \nrailway system.  While agencies can certainly study \nthe \nenvironmental \nrisks \nfrom \nsuch \nincreased \ncommercial activity, the rule of reason places \nreasonable limits on how much study is necessary and \nprevents NEPA from working at cross-purposes with \nthe basic pro-development mission of agencies like \nSTB. \nAs the decision below illustrates, however, the \nD.C. Circuit has replaced this Court\u2019s rule of reason \nwith a mandate to consider everything under the Sun.  \nIf an agency can block a project on the ground that it \n\u201cwould be too harmful to the environment,\u201d then (says \nthe D.C. Circuit) the agency must consider any and all \ndistant environmental effects the project may (or may \nnot) engender\u2014even if the agency has no role in \nregulating those effects, or the conditions that may \nmitigate or exacerbate them.  Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at \n1373.  So, here, the fact that STB can \u201cdeny\u201d the \npermit required for the rail project \u201con the ground that \nthe railway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other \ncosts outweigh its expected benefits\u201d meant that it \nmust consider \u201cthe climate effects of the combustion of \nthe fuel intended to be extracted\u201d\u2014even though STB \nhas zero authority to do anything about oil extraction, \nfuel combustion, or climate effects.  Pet.App.36a-37a, \n66a.  That is not a rule of reason; it is the opposite. \nThis Court long ago cautioned that NEPA \u201cshould \nnot be\u201d turned into \u201ca game\u201d in which environmental \ngroups and other opponents of progress \u201cengage in \n\n49 \nunjustified obstructionism\u201d by raising a laundry list of \nfar-flung effects that, in their view, \u201c\u2018ought to be\u2019 \nconsidered,\u201d no matter how long it takes and no matter \nwhether the agency doing the considering has any \npower to do anything about the supposed problems the \nproject poses.  Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 553-54.  The \nCourt doubled down on that view in Metropolitan \nEdison, emphasizing that policy disagreements should \nbe aired in \u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA\u201d \nlitigation.  460 U.S. at 777.  It bears emphasis that \nNEPA applies equally to legislative proposals and \nagency projects, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and yet \nlegislative proposals do not come encumbered with \n3,600-page EISs.  The explanation for that difference \nlies in the felt-need of agencies to paper the record in \nthe context of projects that can be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Congress recently made its views on the \npotential misuses and excesses of NEPA crystal clear.  \nSee Part I.B., supra.  Yet, as the decision below makes \nall too clear, the home court of appeals for most of the \nfederal alphabet soup agencies has not gotten the \nmessage.  This Court should set the record straight, \nreverse the decision below, and unshackle agencies \nand infrastructure-development projects from NEPA-\nlitigation purgatory. \nIII. The Court Should Confirm That STB\u2019s EIS \nSatisfies NEPA\u2019s Requirements. \nThis is hardly a case of an agency that \ngreenlighted \na \nproject \nheedless \nof \npotential \nenvironmental impacts.  The EIS here runs to 3,600 \npages.  It took years to prepare, and it reflects \nconsultation with sister agencies with expertise in \nparticular areas.  But all that was not remotely good \n\n50 \nenough for the D.C. Circuit, which demanded more \nspeculation and more exhaustive consideration of \nenvironmental (and non-environmental) risks that are \nremote in both time and geography and that implicate \nissues far outside STB\u2019s narrowly focused mandate.  \nSuch an approach threatens a project that promises to \nbring significant economic development to the Uinta \nBasin by connecting that remote area with the \nnational economy.   \nAnd the threat does not end there.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment demands investment, and investors \ndemand a degree of certainty and assurance that they \nwill not become victims of a regulatory rope-a-dope.  \nOpponents of development know full well that they do \nnot need to win every legal battle to prevail in the war \nof attrition.  The decision below is thus a threat not \njust \nto \nthe \npromising \nproject \nhere, \nbut \nto \ninfrastructure development in general. \nThe best way for this Court to send a clear signal \nthat such NEPA abuse will not be tolerated is to \naffirmatively hold that STB\u2019s EIS here passes NEPA \nmuster.  As the preceding discussion reveals, STB\u2019s \nEIS was comprehensive and thoroughgoing.  It readily \ncleared NEPA\u2019s minimum requirements, since it \nstudied all effects on the physical environment \nproximately caused by approving the railroad.  It even \nwent past proximate cause and discussed some remote \neffects and marginal risks like train accidents and \ndown-rail fires.  But that was gravy, not grounds for \nvacatur and additional study.  Although the court of \nappeals may have preferred that discussion to be more \nthorough, that is not the test.  There is no basis for \nreversing a favorable NEPA determination that \n\n51 \nconsiders all of the proximate environmental effects of \nthe proposed project, and the rule of reason protects \nagencies when they go further and consider some \nmarginal risks without exhaustively examining them \nor running down every rabbit hole.  Simply put, absent \na failure to consider an effect that is both proximate \nand environmental, 3,600 pages of EIS ought to be \nmore than enough. \nIn these circumstances, remanding the EIS to the \nagency \nwould \naccomplish \nnothing \nbut \nsowing \nadditional confusion and delay.  To give both \npetitioners and the people of the Uinta Basin the \ncertainty that they deserve, the Court should reverse \nwith language making clear that STB has no \nobligation to revisit its EIS on remand. \n\n52 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJAY C.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v.

This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong.

The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.  Seeking to benefit ranchers, \n\n10 \nfarmers, tribal citizens, and others, the Coalition \nfocused its efforts on rail\u2014a cheaper, safer, and \ncleaner alternative to trucking.  In partnership with \nUinta Basin Railway, LLC, the Coalition sought \napproval from STB to build a new 88-mile rail line \nrunning southwest from the basin to central Utah that \nwould carry diverse commodities to and from the heart \nof \nthe \nbasin \nvia \nthe \nnational \nrail \nnetwork.  \nPet.App.192a. \nThe successor to the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, \nSTB \n\u201cis \nan \nindependent \nfederal \nagency \u2026 charged with the economic regulation of \nvarious modes of surface transportation, primarily \nfreight rail,\u201d but extending to \u201ccertain passenger rail \nmatters, the intercity bus industry, non-energy \npipelines, \nhousehold \ngoods \ncarriers\u2019 \ntariffs, \nand \u2026 non-contiguous domestic water transportation\u201d \nbetween \u201cthe mainland United States, Hawaii, \nAlaska,\u201d and the territories.  Surface Transp. Bd., \nAbout STB, https://bit.ly/3AjwrUO (last visited Aug. \n28, 2024).  As relevant here, Congress made STB \nresponsible for authorizing construction of new \nrailroad lines.  See generally 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901.  \nResponsibility for safety, as distinct from economic, \nregulation of the rails lies elsewhere, in the Federal \nRailroad \nAdministration, \nhoused \nwithin \nthe \nTransportation Department.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin., About FRA, \nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/about-fra \n(last \nvisited Aug. 28, 2024).  Reflecting STB\u2019s relatively \nlimited remit, Congress requires members of the \nBoard to have experience in transportation, economic \nregulation, or business.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a71301(b)(2).   \n\n11 \n2. To help secure financing for the new rail line, \nthe Coalition asked STB to conditionally approve the \nUinta Basin Railway project pending full NEPA \nreview.  Pet.App.204a.  Multiple environmental \ngroups objected, including the Center for Biological \nDiversity, which argued, among other things, that the \nnew rail line would not be financially viable because \n(it said) the basin did not need additional crude-oil \ntransportation \ncapacity. \n \nPet.App.197a. \n \nSTB \nultimately granted conditional approval, but made \nclear that \u201c[c]onstruction may not begin unless and \nuntil the Board issues a final decision\u201d \u201caddressing \nany potential environmental impacts.\u201d  Pet.App.209a.  \nSTB began its NEPA review of the proposed \nrailway in 2019.  Roughly a year and a half later, it \nissued a draft EIS describing the environmental \neffects of three alternative rail alignments and a no-\nbuild alternative.  Pet.App.79a.  STB took the next ten \nmonths to finalize the EIS, reviewing thousands of \ncomments from the public and requesting a report \nfrom the Fish & Wildlife Service about the project\u2019s \nimpact on protected species of fish in the Upper \nColorado River basin.  Pet.App.10a-11a, 50a-51a.  The \nresulting final EIS spanned 3,600 pages and analyzed \nhow \u201cconstruction and operation of the Railway\u201d \nwould impact \u201cwater resources, air quality, special \nstatus species like the greater sage-grouse, land use \nand recreation, local economies, cultural resources, \nand the Ute Indian tribe,\u201d among other things.  \nPet.App.11a; see JA94-105 (EIS table of contents).   \nThe EIS extensively discussed the possibility that \nthe railway might export waxy crude.  \u201cTo the extent \nthat the crude oil would be refined into fuels that \n\n12 \nwould be combusted to produce energy, emissions \nfrom the combustion of the fuels would produce,\u201d \nunder the maximum production scenario, \u201c0.8% of \nnationwide [greenhouse gas] emissions and 0.1% of \nglobal [greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d  Pet.App.106a.  \nThe EIS predicted that roughly half of the oil would be \ndelivered to the Texas Gulf Coast, and another third \nto the Louisiana Gulf Coast, though it could not \n\u201cidentify specific refineries.\u201d  Pet.App.34a, 111a.   \nCloser to the project itself, the EIS estimated the \nnumber of oil wells that would be added in the Basin \ndue to increased oil production enabled by the rail \nproject, while acknowledging that the location of such \n\u201cas yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects\u201d was uncertain.  Pet.App.31a.  The EIS also \nstudied the impact of additional rail traffic on the \nnational rail system, using modeling and historical \ndata to \u201cdetermine[] that the new Railway would lead \nto increased downline traffic, ranging from 0.4 to 9.5 \ntrains per day\u201d and, at most, \u201c0.89 additional \npredicted accidents per year.\u201d  Pet.App.40a.  STB \nultimately concluded that these \u201cminimal increases in \ntrain traffic on existing rail lines over which trains \nalready operate [were] unlikely to cause significant \nimpacts\u201d to vehicle safety and delay, rail safety, noise \nand vibration, air quality, or greenhouse gases.  \nPet.App.110a.   \nIn the end, the EIS concluded that one of the \nalternative rail alignments (the \u201cWhitmore Park \nAlternative\u201d) would \u201cresult in the fewest significant \nimpacts on the environment.\u201d  Pet.App.115a.  The EIS \nalso \nrecommended \nextensive \nenvironmental \n\n13 \nmitigation conditions.  Pet.App.76a; see Pet.App.149a-\n189a.   \nAfter considering the EIS, the Fish & Wildlife \nService\u2019s biological opinion, a separate geological \nstudy evaluating the risk of landslides and other \ngeologic movements, and more, STB issued a final \ndecision approving construction and operation of the \nWhitmore Park Alternative, subject to the mitigation \nrecommendations.  Pet.App.10a-11a.  STB\u2019s final \napproval of the 88-mile railway tracked Congress\u2019 \ndirective in the agency\u2019s organic statute\u2014which \ninstructs STB to approve rail-construction proposals \n\u201cunless [it] finds that such activities are inconsistent \nwith the public convenience and necessity,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n\u00a710901(c); see Mid-States Coal. for Progress v. STB, \n345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) (\u00a710901 creates \u201ca \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved\u201d)\u2014as STB found no basis to conclude from \nthe EIS that any adverse impacts of the new rail line \nwould outweigh the benefits to public convenience and \nnecessity, particularly in light of the extensive \nmitigation requirements the EIS imposed.   \n3. Various environmental groups led by the \nCenter for Biological Diversity sought review of STB\u2019s \ndecision in the D.C. Circuit.  They were joined by \nEagle County, Colorado, which lies hundreds of miles \ndistant from the Uinta Basin, and is significantly \ncloser geographically to Denver than the Utah border.  \nThe court of appeals consolidated the cases and \nallowed Seven County and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC, \nto intervene in defense of STB\u2019s decision.   \nAs relevant here, the Center faulted the EIS for \nnot \u201canalyz[ing] the potential for tens of thousands of \n\n14 \nadditional barrels of oil shipments daily and their \nprocessing in [Gulf Coast] locales to further worsen \npollution burdens.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  The Center likewise \nturned the potential for the railway to spur economic \ndevelopment in a \u201cvast area\u201d against the project, \nflyspecking the EIS for failing to analyze the potential \nfor \u201cwell and road construction, drilling, and truck \ntraffic [to] destroy and degrade habitat.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  \nAnd the Center knocked the EIS for not taking enough \nof \u201ca \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline,\u201d \u201cthe risk and impact of wildfires,\u201d or the \npotential impacts on \u201cthe Colorado River\u201d \u201cgiven the \nincreased rail traffic resulting from the Railway.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a, 46a. \nSTB\u2019s response was straightforward:  Under \nMetropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, it did not \nneed to consider those far-downstream (or down-track) \npotentialities, all of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited \nremit.  STB \u201ccannot regulate or mitigate\u201d any of the \nalleged potential \u201cimpacts\u201d the Center raised.  \nPet.App.31a.  Nor can it accurately predict them.  \n\u201c[A]ny \u2026 development in the Uinta Basin occurring as \na result of the [Railway] will be done in the future as \npart of as yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects that would occur on as yet unidentified \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(second alteration in original).  The amount of new \nconstruction is \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d given the \ninterplay between and among market forces, private \ndecisions, and regulatory actions outside STB\u2019s \ncontrol.  Pet.App.31a.  Likewise, although STB could \nidentify \u201cgeneral geographic regions\u201d where any oil \nmight go to be refined, \u201cthere [wa]s no way to predict \nor assess impacts to specific nearby communities from \n\n15 \nrefining that oil,\u201d because it was impossible to identify \nany one refinery.  Pet.App.31-32a.  And although STB \nestimated that marginal increases in rail traffic could \ncause 0.89 new accidents per year, accidents involving \na loaded crude train would occur far less frequently, \nand the evidence in the record suggested that \nmarginal wildfire risk \u201cwould not be significant.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a-43a, 46a.  \nNone of that was enough for the D.C. Circuit.  The \ndecision below concluded that STB\u2019s \u201cargument that it \nneed not consider effects it cannot prevent is simply \ninapplicable.\u201d  Pet.App.37a.  The court further held \nthat STB \u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could \nnot employ \u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the \naforementioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  \nPet.App.35a.  Invoking its decision in Sabal Trail, the \ncourt found that by taking the trouble to trace \nincreased waxy crude production in rural Utah to \nrefineries on the Gulf Coast, STB had bound itself to \ngo further to analyze the impact of refining activities \non Gulf Coast communities, including contributions to \nclimate \nchange. \n \nPet.App.33a-36a; \nsee \nalso \nPet.App.66a.  The court thus vacated the order and \nremanded for STB to redo the EIS.  Pet.App.70a-71a.1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA imposes a sensible procedural requirement \nthat federal agencies consider a proposed project\u2019s \nenvironmental impact before greenlighting it.  It is not \nsupposed to operate as a substantive obstacle to \n \n1 The D.C. Circuit also remanded for STB to address non-NEPA \nissues and for Fish & Wildlife to address an aspect of its biological \nopinion.  Those non-NEPA issues are not before this Court. \n\n16 \nprojects, requiring agencies to consider remote \npossibilities or empowering project opponents to win a \nwar of attrition by repeatedly forcing agencies to \nconsider just one more possibility.  This Court\u2019s \nprecedents ensure that NEPA strikes a reasonable \nbalance by limiting an agency\u2019s obligations to \nconsidering environmental effects with a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d to the agency\u2019s proposed \naction, and then reviewing the agency\u2019s analysis \nunder NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  The D.C. \nCircuit has lost sight of those limits, as this case \ndramatically illustrates.  STB studied all that NEPA \nrequires and then some in a 3,600-page EIS, but \nenvironmental \nobjectors \nand \nthe \nD.C. \nCircuit \ndemanded still more, including an exhaustive review \nof matters as remote as the impact of additional oil \nrefining (that the new railway theoretically could \nspur) on air quality on the Gulf Coast.  Invoking its \nSabal Trail decision, the D.C. Circuit effectively \npunished STB for going beyond what NEPA requires, \nholding that STB\u2019s efforts to trace increased crude \nproduction to Gulf Coast refineries obligated it to \nstudy environmental effects thousands of miles \nremoved from the project at issue.  There is simply no \nrole under NEPA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s precedents for \nstymying \ndevelopment \nprojects \nbased \non \nenvironmental effects that are so wildly remote in \ngeography and time.  This Court should reaffirm that \nNEPA embodies a demanding form of proximate \ncause, not mere but-for causation, and reverse. \nThis Court has been clear.  \u201cNEPA requires\u201d \nstudying an environmental effect only when there is \n\u201c\u2018a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u2019\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\n17 \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d\u2014\u201cbetween \nthe \nenvironmental \neffect and the alleged cause,\u201d and only when the \nagency \u201chas \u2026 statutory authority over\u201d the \u201ceffect,\u201d \nand thus the \u201cability to prevent\u201d it.  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767, 770 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at \n774).  While the D.C. Circuit cited this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, it required STB\u2019s NEPA analysis to \ntransgress the limits of proximate cause and STB\u2019s \npurview, while giving STB no leeway to make \nreasonable judgments about dim and distant effects. \nThat was legal error.  This Court\u2019s repeated \nemphasis on proximate cause and \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship[s]\u201d between a project and its \nenvironmental effects, Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nrules out the need to consider effects that are far \nremoved in geography and time or that are separated \nby multiple intervening causes that themselves are \nnon-environmental and highly uncertain.  It strains \ncredulity to contend that laying 88 miles of track in \nrural Utah is proximately related to climate change or \nenvironmental harm in Gulf Coast communities.  So \ntoo for potential downline train accidents:  It beggars \nbelief that the legally relevant (i.e., proximate) cause \nof an accident several States away could somehow be \nthe Uinta Basin Railway\u2014and not, for instance, the \nengineer of the relevant train, the train manufacturer, \nor the operator of the relevant track.  Even if the \nproject could be said to be the but-for cause, a tort \nplaintiff suing the agency or the Uinta Basin Railway \nfor a train accident a thousand miles away (let alone \nfor climate change) would be laughed out of court.  The \nresult should be no different just because plaintiffs \nchallenge an EIS under NEPA.  \u201c\u2018[F]or want of a nail, \na kingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \n\n18 \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv\u2019r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nThe decision below also defies NEPA\u2019s \u201cpractical \n\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u201d  N.Y. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. \nKleppe, 97 S.Ct. 4, 6 (1976) (decision of Marshall, J.).  \nNEPA requires agencies to consider proposals \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), not track down \nevery remote or minimal impact.  As one moves from \nthe direct effects of the project to increasingly remote \neffects and mere risks, the agency has discretion to \nignore them or give them more cursory treatment, and \nthe rule of reason prevents a court from forcing an \nagency to consider \u201cinformation\u201d that the agency \ndeems of little \u201cvalue\u201d to the \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374 \n(1989).  For example, whatever the proper solution to \nglobal climate change, the issue must be addressed \nglobally (or at least nationally by EPA), not by \nblocking an 88-mile rail line bringing much-needed \neconomic stability and development to a remote corner \nof Utah.  In practical terms, \u201cno rule of reason worthy \nof that title,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767, would \n\u201coblige\u201d an agency responsible for approving rail \nprojects \n\u201cto \nexpend \nconsiderable \nresources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise\u201d on issues \u201cnot otherwise \nrelevant to [its] congressionally assigned functions,\u201d \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776; see also Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 769.   \nThe decision below is a poster child for converting \na sensible procedural check into a morass that \n\n19 \noperates as a substantive roadblock to development.  \nThe clearest way to put an end to this excess is for this \nCourt to reverse and make clear that the EIS here is \nsufficient.  88 miles of track should not require 3,600 \npages of EIS, let alone a remand for further study of \nwildly remote matters.  This Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nText And Precedent Answer The Question \nPresented In The Negative. \nA. This \nCourt \nHas \nMade \nClear \nThat \nProximate Cause and a Rule of Reason \nSensibly Limit the Scope of NEPA \nReview. \n1. This Court decided Metropolitan Edison in \n1983, four years after a high-profile accident at the \nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant prompted mass \nevacuations and a national reckoning about the safety \nof nuclear power.  Immediately following the accident, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) ordered \nthe power company to shutter the plant indefinitely.  \n460 U.S. at 769.  When the power company sought \npermission to resume operations, the Atomic Energy \nAct required NRC to act as \u201cnecessary or desirable \u2026 \nto protect health or to minimize danger to life or \nproperty.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b).  NEPA also required \nthe Commission to prepare an EIS.  In Metropolitan \nEdison, this Court addressed what environmental \nimpacts NRC needed to consider under NEPA before \nauthorizing Three Mile Island operations to resume. \nThe Court began with statutory text.  Under the \nversion then in effect, NEPA required agencies to \nstudy \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmental effects which \n\n20 \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1975).  As \nthen-Justice Rehnquist explained, this language did \nnot mean that NEPA required the Commission to \nconsider every possible adverse effect of restarting \nThree Mile Island.  460 U.S. at 774.  Rather, \u201cthe \nterms \u2018environmental effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental \nimpact\u2019\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u201d \nakin \nto \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d \u201cbetween\u201d the agency action \u201cand \nthe effect at issue.\u201d  Id.; see also Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 \n(2014) (explaining the settled principle that federal \nstatutes often should be \u201cconstrued \u2026 to incorporate a \nrequirement of proximate causation\u201d). \nWith that statutory construction in hand, the \nCourt unanimously concluded that things like the \n\u201crelease of low-level radiation, increased fog in the \nHarrisburg area (caused by operation of the plant\u2019s \ncooling towers), and the release of warm water into the \nSusquehanna River\u201d were properly on the table for \nNEPA purposes.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775.  \nThese effects, after all, were \u201cproximately related\u201d to \nthe plant resuming operations.  Id. at 774.   \nOn the flip side, the Commission\u2019s EIS did not \nneed to account for \u201cthe potential psychological health \neffects\u201d of reopening the plant on members of the \nsurrounding community, let alone the impact on far-\nflung relatives living hundreds or thousands of miles \naway.  Id. at 771, 774, 777-78.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court did not deny that locals were \nstill reeling from the recent brush with disaster, or \nthat reopening the plant \u201cmay well cause\u201d residents to \n\n21 \nsuffer \n\u201cpsychological \nhealth \nproblems \n\u2026 \nand \naccompanying physical disorders\u201d that derive from \n\u201c\u2018tension and fear.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 774.  But NEPA is \nconcerned with effects of agency action on \u201cthe \nphysical environment\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201c\u2018the air, land and \nwater\u2019\u201d\u2014and such harms were \u201csimply too remote \nfrom the physical environment to justify requiring the \nNRC to evaluate the psychological health damage \u2026 \nthat may be caused by renewed operation of [the \nplant].\u201d  Id. at 773, 774 (emphasis omitted). \nFurthermore, the resumption of operations was \nnot the proximate cause of the health effects \nrespondents raised; those effects instead would \u201cflow \ndirectly from the risk of [a nuclear] accident.\u201d  Id. at \n775 (emphasis added; alteration in original) (quoting \nMetro. Edison Br. for Resps. 23).  \u201cBut a risk of an \naccident is not an effect on the physical environment\u201d \neither.  Id.  \u201cA risk is, by definition, unrealized in the \nphysical world.\u201d  Id. at 767.  What matters under \nNEPA\u2014and what defines the scope of review\u2014is the \nrelationship between the project at issue and changes \nin the physical environment caused by it.  \u201cNEPA does \nnot require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua \nrisk,\u201d of a project moving forward, as opposed to the \nreasonably foreseeable effects of the project itself.  Id. \nat 779.   \nFinally, the Court warned against allowing NEPA \nto be converted into a vehicle for environmental policy \ndisputes.  \u201cThe political process, and not NEPA, \nprovides the appropriate forum in which to air policy \ndisagreements.\u201d  Id. at 777. \nMetropolitan Edison all but resolves this case.  If \nNEPA did not require consideration of allegedly direct \n\n22 \nhealth consequences of the ripped-from-the-headlines \nrisk of another nuclear meltdown before restarting \nThree Mile Island, then it is hard to demand that \nSTB\u2019s EIS here consider the risk of accidents on \nexisting tracks hundreds of miles away, let alone the \nremote and theoretical risk that the Uinta Basin \nRailway could cause future harm to communities near \nGulf Coast refineries.  But if any doubt remained post-\nMetropolitan Edison, Public Citizen settled it. \n2. The question in Public Citizen was whether, \nwhen deciding what safety regulations should govern \nMexican trucks operating in the United States, the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration needed \nto consider the Mexican trucks\u2019 contribution to \ndomestic air pollution.  541 U.S. at 756.  Unlike \nMetropolitan Edison, the question was not risk\u2014e.g., \nthe \nrisk \nthat \nMexican \ntrucks \nwould \nhave \nenvironmentally damaging accidents in the United \nStates or impact traffic patterns in ways that affected \ndistant communities\u2014but the certainty that Mexican \ntrucks would cause additional air pollution.  After all, \nthe regulations were the last thing standing in the \nway of President Bush\u2019s directive to allow Mexican \ntrucks to operate in the United States.  Id. at 765-66.   \nNevertheless, even though the agency action was \nplainly the but-for cause of that increased pollution, \nthe Court concluded that it landed outside NEPA\u2019s \nrequired scope.  Id. at 770.  The Court clarified that \u201ca \n\u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is insufficient to make an \nagency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA \nand the relevant regulations.\u201d  Id. at 767.  Rather, \nNEPA requires agencies to consider only those effects \nproximately caused by the proposed action.  Id.  Given \n\n23 \nthe President\u2019s order, the agency could not simply \ndecline to issue regulations, and so\u2014while the agency \naction allowing the Mexican trucks into the country \nwas plainly a but-for cause of increased pollution\u2014\n\u201cthe President,\u201d \u201cnot\u201d any \u201caction\u201d by the agency, was \n\u201cthe legally relevant cause.\u201d  Id. at 760-61, 769; see \nalso id. at 767 (noting that \u201cproximate cause analysis \nturns on,\u201d among other things, \u201cconsiderations of the \n\u2018legal responsibility\u2019 of actors\u201d (quoting W. Page \nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 275 \n(5th ed. 1984))). \nThe Court likewise invoked NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason,\u201d which ensures that agencies need not engage \nin endless environmental reviews that would frustrate \nthe agency\u2019s primary mission or \u201cserve no purpose in \nlight of NEPA\u2019s regulatory scheme as a whole.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents there argued that while the President\u2019s \ndecision required the agency to allow the trucks into \nthe country, the agency still needed to consider \npollution, on the theory that it might matter on the \nmargins when selecting among the menu of possible \nsafety regulations.  This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would require an \nagency\u201d against its will to study environmental effects \nfalling outside its \u201cability to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 767, 770.   \n3. Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen suffice \nto resolve this case in petitioners\u2019 favor, but they are \nfar from the only decisions of this Court holding that \nonly proximate environmental effects count, and an \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis need not consider remote \nenvironmental effects, non-environmental effects, \npure risk, or matters beyond the agency\u2019s remit. \n\n24 \nIn Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \nfor instance, the Forest Service authorized the \ndevelopment of a major new ski resort in a \u201csparsely \npopulated area\u201d of the Cascade Mountains.  490 U.S. \nat 337.  The resort quickly got bogged down in \nlitigation.  Environmental groups challenged the \nadequacy of the EIS, which recognized that off-site \ndevelopment on private land \u201ccould \u2026 degrad[e] \u2026 \nexisting air quality\u201d but did not delve deeply into the \nair-quality issue.  Id. at 339-40, 344-45.  They further \nargued the EIS needed to conduct a \u201cworst case\u201d \nanalysis of impacts to the local mule-deer population \nand that the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that those \neffects were \u201cuncertain[]\u201d did not suffice.  Id. at 343, \n347.  This Court rejected both arguments with a nod \nto NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Because the county, not \nthe Forest Service, had primary jurisdiction over air \nquality, \u201c[t]he off-site effects on air quality and on the \nmule deer herd\u201d would \u201cbe subject to regulation by \nother \ngovernmental \nbodies\u201d \nwith \nprimary \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the effects and \u201cauthority to \nmitigate them.\u201d  Id. at 350, 352.  \u201c[I]t would be \nincongruous to conclude that the Forest Service\u201d was \nresponsible to develop related mitigation measures.  \nId. at 352-53.2 \n \n2 Unfortunately, that conclusion was not enough to save the \nresort:  Despite heralding the region as \u201cthe best potential \ndestination ski resort in the United States,\u201d Aspen Ski \nCorporation ultimately \u201cbec[a]me weary of the seemingly never-\nending lawsuits\u201d and sold the property to another developer, who \nitself \u201cran out of cash\u201d after \u201cspen[ding] roughly $12 million on \nland and legal fees.\u201d  Ryan Flynn, Early Winters Resort, WA:  A \nSki Hill That Never Was, SnowBrains (Jan. 8, 2024), \n \n\n25 \nThe Court reached a similar conclusion for similar \nreasons in Vermont Yankee.  There, the Court brushed \nback the suggestion that an EIS must \u201cferret out every \npossible\u201d way to mitigate environmental effects, \nparticularly when those effects fall into the domain of \n\u201cstate public utility commissions or similar bodies.\u201d  \n435 U.S. at 550-51, 558.  And in Baltimore Gas and \nElectric, this Court blessed NRC\u2019s use of generic rules \nto evaluate the environmental effects of nuclear power \ngeneration generally, rather than via a power-plant-\nspecific analysis.  As the Court there put it, \u201cCongress \ndid not enact NEPA \u2026 so that an agency would \ncontemplate the environmental impact of an action as \nan abstract exercise\u201d; agencies \u201cha[ve] discretion\u201d \nunder \nNEPA \nto \n\u201ccho[ose]\u201d \nto \n\u201cevaluate \n\u2026 \nenvironmental impact[s]\u201d \u201cgenerically,\u201d rather than \nspecifically, to \u201cfurther[]\u201d \u201c[a]dministrative efficiency \nand consistency of decision.\u201d  462 U.S. at 100-01. \n* * * \nThe lessons of this Court\u2019s NEPA cases are clear, \nyet they all seemed lost on the D.C. Circuit in its \ndecision below.  NEPA requires agencies to study only \nenvironmental effects proximately caused by the \nproposed agency action.  NEPA does not require \nagencies to study remote environmental effects, non-\nenvironmental effects, risks, or factors outside the \nagency\u2019s control.  Nor does an agency have to consider \nevery effect that may (or may not) flow from conduct \nor events that a proposed project may (or may not) \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4fAPp9W.  That result underscores the risk that \nNEPA litigation allows environmental opponents of agency-\napproved projects to lose the NEPA battle while still winning the \nwar of attrition. \n\n26 \nspur, just because the agency could ensure that those \npotential future consequences never arise by denying \na permit and cutting off the proposed action \naltogether.  Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nboth say so directly and confirm that the D.C. Circuit \nerred in requiring STB to consider far-downstream \nconsequences as part of its NEPA review.   \nThat proximate-cause limit tethered to the project \nitself is buttressed by NEPA\u2019s rule of reason, which \nputs sensible limits on what an agency must study.  In \nPublic Citizen, even though pollution from Mexican \ntrucks was a certain, direct environmental effect of the \nFederal \nMotor \nCarrier \nSafety \nAdministration \npromulgating its safety regulations, the agency did \nnot need to study pollution from increased truck \ntraffic, because the agency \u201cha[d] no statutory \nauthority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to \nestablish environmental requirements unrelated to \nmotor carrier safety.\u201d  541 U.S. at 759.  Likewise in \nRobertson, even if air pollution from off-site \ndevelopment was a certain, direct environmental \neffect of licensing the ski resort, the Forest Service \nwould not need to study it, because it would fall within \nthe County\u2019s authority.  Once again, those cases \nconfirm that the D.C. Circuit erred in holding that \nSTB must conduct a full-scale NEPA review of issues \nfar outside its limited remit, but well within the \npurview of other agencies\u2019 authority\u2014especially when \nthose other agencies can address such issues more \ncomprehensively, rather than making a relatively \nmodest infrastructure project the scapegoat for \neverything from upstream mining to downstream \naccident risks and climate change. \n\n27 \nB. The \nBUILDER \nAct \nButtresses \nthe \nLimitations on NEPA Review That This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Recognize and Enforce. \nThis Court has long \u201capplied the standard \nrequirement of proximate cause to actions under \nfederal statutes\u201d even though \u201cthe text did not \nexpressly provide for it.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nMcBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting).  As of 2023, NEPA\u2019s text does provide for \nit.  While not directly applicable to this pre-Act project, \nCongress codified in the BUILDER Act what this \nCourt has long held, making clear that the scope of \nNEPA \nreview \nturns \non \nforeseeability \nand \nreasonableness\u2014i.e., proximate cause\u2014and that \nNEPA does not alter statutory provisions delimiting \nan agency\u2019s authority or mission. \nAs amended by the BUILDER Act, NEPA now \nprovides as follows: \n(2) [A]ll agencies of the Federal Government \nshall\u2014 \n(C) \u2026 except where compliance would be \ninconsistent \nwith \nother \nstatutory \nrequirements, \ninclude \nin \nevery \nrecommendation or report on proposals for \nlegislation and other major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on\u2014 \n(i) \nthe \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nenvironmental impact effects of the \nproposed agency action,; \n\n28 \n(ii) \nany \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal be implemented,; [and] \n(iii) \na \nreasonable \nrange \nof \nalternatives to the proposed agency \naction, including an analysis of any \nnegative environmental impacts of \nnot \nimplementing \nthe \nproposed \nagency action in the case of a no \naction \nalternative, \nthat \nare \ntechnically \nand \neconomically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposal[.]  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332 (2023) (additions underlined; \ndeletions stricken). \nThese \nclarifying \nchanges \nunderscore \nthat \nCongress has embraced this Court\u2019s decisions, which \nkeep NEPA as a manageable procedural check, rather \nthan a substantive roadblock to infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The BUILDER Act makes explicit what \nthis Court already held was implicit by textually \nadopting the language of proximate cause.  See, e.g., \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) \n(proximate cause is \u201coften explicated in terms of \nforeseeability\u201d).  That strongly reinforces this Court\u2019s \ndecisions.  After all, if Congress can \u201ccarry forward\u201d \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nstatutory \nprecedents \nmerely \nby \n\u201cperpetuating the [same] wording\u201d (i.e., doing nothing \nin response to this Court\u2019s statutory decisions), then \nCongress\u2019 affirmative choice to adopt new language \nembracing prior statutory precedents of this Court \nsupplies a strong signal that those precedents were \n\n29 \ncorrect.  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \nThe BUILDER Act likewise embraces the rule of \nreason recognized in Public Citizen.  The Act\u2019s title \nunderscores Congress\u2019 intent for NEPA review to be \nnarrow and efficient, rather than unwieldy and anti-\ndevelopment.  See id. at 221 (noting that statutory \ntitles provide a \u201cpermissible indicator[] of meaning\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the Act continues to limit NEPA to projects \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and it now \nexpressly \nabsolves \nagencies \nof \nconsidering \nalternatives \nthat \nare \nnot \n\u201creasonable,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) (2023), and presumptively limits the \nEIS process to no more than \u201c2 years\u201d and an EIS itself \nto \u201c150 pages,\u201d id. \u00a74336a(e)(1), (g)(1).  What is more, \nit makes explicit that when Congress assigns an \nagency to administer a decidedly pro-development \nstatute\u2014as \nit \nhas \ndone \nwith \nSTB \nand \nrail \nconstruction, see p.10, supra\u2014NEPA does not stand in \nthe way; the agency need only weigh alternatives that \n\u201cmeet the purpose and need of the proposal\u201d and \nevaluate the cost of doing nothing.  Id. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) \n(2023).   \nAt bottom, the BUILDER Act not only endorses \nthis Court\u2019s focus on proximate cause and underscores \nthat limits on an agency\u2019s regulatory mission and its \nsubject-matter portfolio are baked into the rule of \nreason, but illustrates the folly in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nboil-the-ocean mandate here. \n\n30 \nII. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA And This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Applying It.   \nThis Court\u2019s NEPA precedents and Congress\u2019 \nrecent and emphatic reaffirmation of them confirm \nthat NEPA envisions a procedural cross-check, not a \nsubstantive roadblock.  And NEPA\u2019s procedural cross-\ncheck is not designed to be unduly onerous or to \nresemble a Sisyphean task, where there is always one \nadditional and increasingly remote effect or risk that \nmust be considered.  To the contrary, NEPA strikes a \nsensible balance where an agency need only consider \nproximate environmental effects and judgments about \nwhat to consider are protected from endless second-\nguessing by a rule of reason.  Striking this balance \nensures that NEPA will continue to facilitate \u201cfully \ninformed and well-considered decision[s]\u201d while \nremaining \u201cbounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551, 558.  It likewise ensures that \n\u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA, provides the \nappropriate \nforum \nin \nwhich \nto \nair \npolicy \ndisagreements\u201d with a project that meets all the \nsubstantive criteria for agency approval.  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 777. \nThe decision below upsets that balance and \nthreatens to block vital infrastructure development \nunder the guise of just a little more process.  The \nimpact (if any) of 88 new miles of track in an isolated \ncorner of Utah on train accidents hundreds of miles \naway or the air quality of refining communities on the \nGulf Coast or on climate change is the very definition \nof remote, not proximate, cause.  And despite the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s view that NEPA demands a never-ending \nprocess, it was eminently reasonable for an agency \n\n31 \nresponsible for administering an explicitly pro-\ndevelopment statute to decline to consider de minimis \nenvironmental impacts that are little more than the \ninevitable consequences of development and that \nshould be regulated (if at all) as part of a \ncomprehensive scheme administered by a different \nagency.  To state the obvious, the solution to the global \nissue of climate change does not lie in blocking 88 \nmiles of track or keeping the Uinta Basin isolated from \nthe national economy.   \nA. The \nDecision \nBelow \nDemanded \nConsideration of Non-Proximate and \nNon-Environmental Effects. \n1. If a train collision occurs in the middle of \nColorado and winds up in court, there are plenty of \npotential tort defendants:  the hapless train engineer, \nthe careless builder of the malfunctioning train, the \nmanufacturer of the unsafe track, the negligent \ndispatcher who was on duty, or perhaps even the \nreckless safety regulator who ignored advice to lower \nthe relevant speed limit.  Only the most creative of \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2014and least successful, given the \nwell-established limits of proximate cause\u2014would \nthink to sue the operator of an 88-mile rail line that \nbegins and ends in rural Utah or the regulator who \napproved it on the theory that it increased downline \naccident risk by less than a percentage point. \nThat would be true a fortiori for consequences on \nthe ground (or in the air above it) from increased waxy \ncrude refining on the Gulf Coast\u2014and doubly so of \neffects of such refining on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as \nchanges or increases in refining are strictly regulated \nby other agencies.  Not even Helen Palsgraf could have \n\n32 \ndreamed of a judicial opinion finding 88 miles of track \nwholly in rural Utah to be the proximate cause of \nfuture air pollution on the Gulf Coast and its \nramifications for Gulf refining communities\u2014to say \nnothing of one linking the railway to monsoons in the \nSouth Pacific.   \nWhile well-established principles of proximate \ncause would stop such fanciful lawsuits at the starting \ngate, the D.C. Circuit put STB on the hook for \nstudying similarly remote effects of approving 88 \nmiles of rail line in rural Utah.  The D.C. Circuit \njustified that burden not by expressly finding air \npollution on the Gulf Coast or downline accidents to be \nproximately caused by the project, but by emphasizing \nthat STB has the authority to deny the permit \nnecessary for the project if it \u201cfinds that such activities \nare inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d  See Pet.App.36a-37a; 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901(c). \nThat analytical leap hopelessly conflates but-for \nand proximate cause.  An agency can avoid any \nnumber of remote impacts and risks of harmful \nactivity by denying a required permit, because the \nvery nature of a permit makes it a necessary but-for \ncause of the permitted activity.  But this Court has \nrepeatedly rejected the notion that NEPA embodies \nsuch a \u201c\u2018but-for\u2019 causation\u201d standard.  Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 767.  In its place, and in order to protect \nthe \u201cmanageable\u201d and balanced approach that \nCongress intended, see Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776, \nNEPA requires agencies to study only proximate \nenvironmental effects.  In light of \u201cthe congressional \nconcerns that led to the enactment of NEPA,\u201d \u201c[s]ome \neffects\u201d of a proposed project \u201cthat are \u2018caused by\u2019 a \n\n33 \nchange in the physical environment in the sense of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation, will nonetheless not fall within [NEPA] \nbecause the causal chain is too attenuated.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nStated more succinctly, proximate cause is the \ntouchstone for an EIS\u2014and where proximate cause \nends, so ends the scope of what NEPA requires.   \nMoreover, as this Court has emphasized, the focus \nof the proximate-cause inquiry is on the project itself, \nnot on subsequent activities a project may someday \nenable.  See id. at 771-79; pp.20-21, supra.  NEPA \nrequires \u201ca detailed statement\u201d of \u201cthe environmental \nimpact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2019) \n(emphases added).3  Thus, \u201cto decide what kind of an \n[EIS] need be prepared, it is necessary first to describe \naccurately the \u2026 \u2018action\u2019 being taken.\u201d  Aberdeen & \nRockfish R.R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U.S. 289, 322 (1975); \nsee also Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 395-402 \n(1976).  And the same is true for the proximate-cause \ninquiry.  \u201cTo determine whether [NEPA] requires \nconsideration of a particular effect, we must look at \nthe relationship between that effect and the change in \nthe physical environment caused by the major federal \naction at issue.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773 \n(emphasis added).  What matters, in other words, is \nthe relationship between the project and changes in \nthe physical environment caused by it.  \n \n3 The language under the BUILDER Act is substantially \nsimilar.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2023) (requiring \u201ca detailed \nstatement\u201d of, inter alia, \u201creasonably foreseeable environmental \neffects of the proposed agency action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed agency action\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnder that rubric, changes in the physical \nenvironment that have a reasonably close causal \nrelationship to a proposed project must be considered \nas part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review.  But changes in \nthe physical environment that are remote from a \nproposed project in space and time need not be \nconsidered as part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review, \nbecause \nthose \neffects \nare, \nby \ndefinition, \nnot \nproximately caused by the project.  Likewise, \nenvironmental effects that flow from subsequent \nactions that the project may (or may not) ultimately \nenable need not be considered under NEPA, as such \nuncertain potentialities likewise lie well beyond the \nscope of proximate environmental effects. \nThat sensible proximate-cause limit focused on \nthe project itself is reinforced by NEPA\u2019s direction to \nconsider alternatives.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii).  \nIt makes perfect sense for an agency to consider three \nalternative rail routes to connect the Uinta Basin with \nthe national rail system, as well as a no-action \nalternative.  See pp.11-13, supra.  If one route \nendangers important habitat or threatens a pristine \nriver, then the EIS helpfully directs the agency to an \nalternative.  But it is completely infeasible to consider \nevery alternative for the cargo that could be carried on \ndistant rail lines, the development the rail line could \nprecipitate in the Uinta Basin, or the permutations for \nthe mix and quantity of crude refined on the Gulf \nCoast.  And NEPA directs agencies to consider all \nalternatives in the same manner, not to go to the ends \nof the Earth vis-\u00e0-vis the principal proposal and give \nonly cursory consideration to the alternatives.  Thus, \nthe only conclusion consistent with NEPA\u2019s text and \nthe imperative to keep NEPA analysis within \n\n35 \nreasonable bounds is to consider only a manageable \nrange of proximate environmental effects of all \nalternatives.  Any other conclusion would leave \nagencies (and courts) with impossible burdens and \nwithout \u201ca manageable line between those causal \nchanges that may make an actor responsible for an \neffect and those that do not.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7). \n2. The D.C. Circuit lost sight of these important \nprinciples here.  The court of appeals perceived three \nfailings in the EIS:  failing to adequately consider \n(1) \u201cthe effects of increased crude oil refining on Gulf \nCoast \ncommunities \nin \nLouisiana \nand \nTexas\u201d; \n(2) \u201cdownline effects of projected increases in spills \nand accidents from additional oil trains traveling the \nexisting Union Pacific rail line\u201d; and (3) the \u201cupline \nimpacts on vegetation or special status species\u201d that \nmight be found near potential well sites if the new \nrailway \nspurs \nindependent \ndevelopment.  \nPet.App.12a-13a; see also Pet.App.30a-37a, 40a-47a.   \nJust quoting those supposedly \u201comitted\u201d impacts \nconfirms that the D.C. Circuit went well beyond \nproximate environmental effects of adding 88 miles of \nrail in rural Utah.  First, any impact on Gulf Coast \ncommunities in Louisiana and Texas is wildly remote \nin multiple dimensions.  There are multiple States, \nand more than a thousand miles, between the 88 miles \nof track in Utah and the Gulf Coast.   \nAnd there is arguably an even greater gap \nbetween the project and any material increase in \ncrude oil refining in those remote areas.  Even \ncrediting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s apparent assumption that \nall crude shipped on a common-carrier rail line will \n\n36 \nend up at a specific destination in the Gulf Coast, \nwhether there will even be an increase in crude oil \nrefining on the Gulf Coast depends on the amount of \nwaxy crude shipped on the new line and how that \ncompares to the status quo ante with truck \ntransportation, see CADCJA230, \u201cthe ability and \nwillingness\u201d of the refineries in those areas to receive \nand process waxy crude oil, JA477, and (among many \nother things) the actions of myriad local, state, and \nfederal regulators who already directly oversee the \nrefineries\u2019 operations.  Figuring out \u201cthe climate \neffects of the combustion of the fuel intended to be \nextracted\u201d thus depends on guessing which part (or \nparts) of the Gulf Coast might receive and refine the \noil; speculating whether and to what degree waxy \ncrude from the Uinta Basin will augment existing \nrefining activity, rather than just displace refining \ncrude from elsewhere (and, if so, what kind of crude is \ndisplaced); estimating the relative impacts of refining \none form of crude versus another; and then inferring \nthat the environmental protections already in place \n(due to action by EPA and state regulators, not STB) \nwould fail to protect the surrounding community from \nany marginal increase in refining output.  All of those \nare \u201cmiddle links\u201d that render \u201cthe effects of increased \ncrude oil refining on Gulf Coast communities in \nLouisiana and Texas\u201d far too remote from a new \nrailway line in rural Utah and far too speculative to \njustify NEPA review of those highly contingent \npotentialities.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775. \nThe \u201cdownline\u201d effects of STB\u2019s decision are, if \nanything, even more contingent and remote.  As part \nof its NEPA review, STB used models to predict how \nmany trains would be added to other rail lines.  Based \n\n37 \non that prediction, STB estimated that the additional \ntrain cars would result in less than one\u20140.89, to be \nexact\u2014additional \ntrain \naccident \neach \nyear.  \nPet.App.40a-41a.  And even that number oversells the \npoint.  Where such an accident would occur; whether \nit would be serious or minor; whether it would involve \ncars that were empty or full; and whether it would \ncause any damage to the physical environment \nhundreds or thousands of miles removed from the \nUinta Basin are all matters of complete guesswork.  As \nnoted, any plaintiff trying to sue the operators of the \n88 miles of rural Utah track (or STB) for a train \naccident in Colorado, Louisiana, or anywhere in \nbetween would be laughed out of court.  The most that \ncould be said is that STB approval of the 88 miles at \nissue here was a but-for cause of the future accident.  \nTo argue that the accident was a proximate \nenvironmental effect drains those words of meaning \nand defies this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThe same is true of the potential that, if the \nrailway spurs new development in the Uinta Basin, \nthat new development may have effects on the \nsurrounding environs.  See Pet.App.31a.  Initially, \nthat risk depends on the assumption that the new rail \nline will carry substantial amounts of waxy crude\u2014by \nno means a certainty, as evidenced by the fact that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity previously contended \nthat market demand for oil could never sustain the \nrailway. \n \nSee \nPet.App.197a-198a. \n \nAnd \nthe \nassumptions spin out from there.  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nown \ndescription \nof \nSTB\u2019s \nsupposed \nomissions \nunderscores that it has gone well beyond proximate \nenvironmental effects of the project itself.  The D.C. \nCircuit demanded consideration of \u201cas yet unknown \n\n38 \nand unplanned independent projects that would occur \non as yet unidentified private, state, tribal, or federal \nland,\u201d \u201cundertaken \u2018by as yet unknown entities and \nlicensed or permitted by other federal agencies, state \nand local governments, or the Ute Tribe, depending on \nthe location of the development,\u2019\u201d at a level that is \n\u201csimply unknown and unknowable.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(quoting CADC.Gov.Br.35-36).  The court should have \nstopped well before the fourth \u201cunknown.\u201d  None of \nthose unknowns is a proximate consequence of the \nproject, as opposed to a potential consequence of \nindependent development that the project may (or \nmay not) spur and that could pose some harm to the \nenvironment, \ndespite \nwhatever \nenvironmental \nanalysis is required if, and when, any concrete future \nprojects materialize. \nTo be sure, an agency must make some educated \nassumptions about environmental effects that are \ncertain but hard to quantify, to \u201censure[] that [those] \nimportant \neffects \nwill \nnot \nbe \noverlooked \nor \nunderestimated,\u201d and to \u201cprovide[] a springboard for \npublic comment.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.  In \nMetropolitan Edison, for example, NRC needed to \nmake educated assumptions about the \u201crelease of low-\nlevel radiation, increased fog in the [surrounding] area \n(caused by operation of the plant\u2019s cooling towers), and \nthe release of warm water into [a nearby] River.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 775.  But those were all actual effects of the \nproject itself.  Environmental consequences that may \n(or may not) arise if a project spurs other conduct (i.e., \nother non-environmental consequences) are not \nproximate effects of a project.  The project may be their \nbut-for cause\u2014but if one thing is clear in this context, \n\n39 \nit is that but-for cause is not enough.  The D.C. Circuit \nignored that critical limitation here.4 \nIndeed, the decision below ended up light-years \naway from any recognizable notion of proximate cause.  \nAccording to the court, the \u201cforeseeable environmental \neffects of the project\u201d include \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at new \noil wells that do not yet exist, but that may (or may not) \nbe constructed if the project is approved and it \nincreases demand for waxy crude from the Uinta \nBasin.  Pet.App.66a.  It would be a stretch to argue \nthat 88 miles of rail is the proximate cause of the \nextraction of any fuel, given the myriad factors that go \ninto energy extraction (market demands, emergence of \nnew technology, business expansion and contraction, \njust to name a few).  It would take proximate causation \nwell past its breaking point to try to connect the new \nrail with \u201cthe combustion\u201d of said fuel.  Yet the D.C. \nCircuit went further still, asserting that the new rail \nis the proximate cause of the climate effects of such \ncombustion.  That \u201csounds absurd, because it is.\u201d  \nSekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 738 (2013). \n3. The problems with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nrun deeper still.  NEPA requires consideration only of \n \n4 The regulations in effect at the relevant time here defined \n\u201ceffects\u201d to include both direct and indirect effects, with the latter \nencompassing effects \u201clater in time or farther removed in \ndistance\u201d than the former.  40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.8(a)-(b) (2019).  But \n\u201ceffects\u201d still must be effects of the project itself\u2014and even the \nindirect effects must \u201cstill [be] reasonably foreseeable,\u201d id. \n\u00a71508.8(b), i.e., proximately related to the agency action and \nproject at issue.  To the extent the courts of appeals have \ninterpreted the phrase \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d more broadly, \nthey have misapplied this Court\u2019s decisions. \n\n40 \nproximate effects of proposed projects on the physical \nenvironment, i.e., \u201cthe air, land and water.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772-73 (emphasis removed).  \u201cIf a \nharm does not have a sufficiently close connection to \nthe physical environment, NEPA does not apply.\u201d  Id. \nat 778.  Put simply, what matters is a project\u2019s \nproximate environmental effects; non-environmental \neffects, even if proximate, need not be considered.  The \ndecision \nbelow \ncannot \nbe \nsquared \nwith \nthat \nfundamental limitation on NEPA review. \nTake the risk of downline train accidents.  Even \nassuming that a new, 88-mile railway in rural Utah \nmight be the but-for cause of additional traffic on rail \nlines hundreds of miles distant, which in turn might \neventually contribute to an accident that would not \nhave occurred if the Uinta Basin remained cut off from \nthe national rail system, it does not follow that the \naccident would have any meaningful impact on the \n\u201cair, land and water.\u201d  If the train cars were unloaded \nor carrying innocuous cargo, there would be a safety \nrisk for the Federal Railway Administration to \nconsider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.  \n\u201cNEPA does not require the agency to assess every \nimpact or effect of its proposed action, but only the \nimpact or effect on the environment.\u201d  Id. at 772. \nAt most, then, the D.C. Circuit could only have \nrequired STB to reconsider (the vanishingly narrow \nand remote universe of) downline accidents actually \naffecting the physical environment.  But even limiting \nthe remand to train accidents actually impacting the \nphysical environment does not solve the problem; it \njust highlights that the decision below forces STB to \n\n41 \nevaluate \u201crisk, qua risk.\u201d  See id. at 779.  NEPA \nrequires STB \u201cto prepare an EIS evaluating\u201d harms \nthat are \u201cproximately related to a change in the \nphysical environment.\u201d  Id. at 774.  But the only \nreasonably foreseeable effect of connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the broader national rail system is that \nthere likely will be a very small number of new \naccidents.  That is not an environmental effect at all. \n* * * \nAll told, this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents make clear \nthat the metes and bounds of what an agency must \nanalyze under NEPA should be cabined by what is \nnecessary for the statute to fulfill its important, but \nlimited, mission:  \u201cto promote human welfare by \nalerting governmental actors to the effect of their \nproposed actions on the physical environment.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772.  That makes this case \nstraightforward.  To the extent the proposed project \nhas actual environmental effects that are reasonably \nforeseeable consequences of the project itself, those \neffects must be analyzed (and, as explained, they were \nand then some).  But to the extent the project has non-\nenvironmental effects\u2014ranging from spurring new \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin, to (an infinitesimally \nsmall number of) increased rail accidents downline, to \na change in the quantity or mix of refining activities \non the Gulf Coast\u2014the risk of some environmental \nharm from those activities need not be considered \nunder NEPA.  Thus, in concrete terms, since \napproving the track could cross a critical habitat, \ncontribute to air pollution in the Uinta Basin, or \nchange the topography in a way that causes run-off to \nenter a mountain lake, STB properly studied these \n\n42 \nadverse effects of the project, relying as necessary on \ninput from other agencies, reasonable forecasting, and \neducated assumptions.  But it just as properly \ndeclined to go further to consider risks beyond the \neffect of the proposed action \u201con the physical \nenvironment.\u201d  See id. \nNo one\u2014save, perhaps, project opponents who \nbenefit from delay\u2014would be served by a system \n\u201crequir[ing] detailed discussion of \u2026 effects [that] \ncannot be readily ascertained\u201d in a way that is \n\u201c[in]compatible with the time-frame of the needs to \nwhich the underlying proposal is addressed.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551.  And even if agencies did turn \nover every speculative rock (although there is always \nthe possibility of studying the next-most remote and \nspeculative risk), the resulting EISs would skew \ndecisionmaking by overemphasizing \u201csmall, often \nirrelevant, losses from the proposed new projects,\u201d and \nallowing them to distract from \u201cthe gains [in] \nenvironmental innovation.\u201d  Richard A. Epstein, The \nMany Sins of NEPA, 6 Tex. A&M L. Rev. 1, 3 (2018). \nIn short, \u201c[t]he scope of the agency\u2019s inquiries \nmust remain manageable if NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018ensur[ing] \na fully informed and well considered decision\u2019 is to be \naccomplished.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. \nat 558).  The decision below defies that imperative. \nB. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA\u2019s Rule \nof Reason. \nAs the preceding section explains, the lack of \nproximate cause and actual environmental effects \nfrom the project suffice to explain why STB did not \nneed to consider the three \u201comissions\u201d identified by the \n\n43 \nD.C Circuit.  But STB actually did exercise its \ndiscretion to consider some of these issues in its EIS.  \nFor example, STB used models to predict how many \ntrains would be added to other rail lines, as well as \n\u201cnational data for train accident rates\u201d to predict \nmarginal \nrisks \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \ntrains.  \nPet.App.40a.  The Board likewise employed maps of \nwildfire potential to conclude that the risk of downline \nfires was miniscule.  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s real gripe was not that these effects went \nunstudied, but rather that the court felt that STB \nshould have gone further in its studies.  That is a rule \nof bottomless process, not a rule of reason\u2014and it \ndefies this Court\u2019s precedents.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas, 462 U.S. at 103 (\u201cA reviewing court should not \nmagnify a single line item beyond its significance as \nonly part of a larger Table.\u201d). \nIndeed, when it came to the environmental effects \non communities on the Gulf Coast, the D.C. Circuit \nwent even further and effectively punished STB for \ngoing beyond what NEPA requires.  Given that any \nenvironmental effect on Gulf Coast communities is \nremote and speculative, STB could have simply \ndismissed any such effect as hopelessly remote.  Cf. \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 (rejecting any need to \nconsider psychological effects on far-flung relatives of \nlocal residents).  But STB nonetheless went beyond \nthe call of legal duty to try to trace potential increases \nin waxy crude production to refineries on the Gulf \nCoast, while disclaiming any ability to identify \nparticular refineries.  Applying the no-good-deed-goes-\nunpunished rule of Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat by tracing the waxy crude to Gulf Coast \nrefineries, STB obligated itself to go further and study \n\n44 \nenvironmental effects on Gulf Coast communities and \nthe \nrefineries \ncontribution \nto \nclimate \nchange.  \nPet.App.34a-35a. \nThat approach gets matters almost exactly \nbackwards and defies this Court\u2019s direction to apply a \n\u201cpractical rule of reason\u201d to agency determinations \nand go no further in studying increasingly remote \nenvironmental effects.  Once an EIS analyzes a \nproject\u2019s proximate environmental effects, there is no \nvalid basis for a court to demand more.  The agency \ncan choose to go further, if time and resources allow.  \nBut the agency should not be faulted, let alone \nreversed, for going beyond what is legally required.  \nAnd if the agency concludes that investing additional \nbandwidth into studying a distant or speculative \nenvironmental effect is unlikely to be helpful, then a \ncourt has no \u201cmeaningful standard[]\u201d with which to \nsecond-guess the agency\u2019s judgment.  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 679-80 (2023).  \u201cTo require \notherwise would render agency decisionmaking \nintractable.\u201d  Marsh, 490 U.S. at 373. \nAn agency can deem further study unhelpful for \nany number of reasons.  As in Public Citizen, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when the \nagency lacks the legal \u201cability to prevent\u201d  the studied \neffect.  541 U.S. at 770.  Or, as in Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency might deem further study unhelpful when \nthe agency lacks subject-matter expertise to evaluate \nthe effect:  \u201cTime and resources are simply too \nlimited \u2026 to believe that Congress intended to\u201d \n\u201coblige[]\u201d agencies \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise that is not otherwise relevant \nto their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  460 U.S. \n\n45 \nat 776; see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n729 (2022) (\u201c\u2018When [an] agency has no comparative \nexpertise\u2019 in making certain policy judgments \u2026 \n\u2018Congress presumably would not\u2019 task it with doing \nso.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Kisor v. Wilkie, \n588 U.S. 558, 578 (2019))).  Or, as in Robertson, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when \nanother regulator has primary responsibility for \nremediating \nthe \nstudied \neffect \nin \na \nmore \ncomprehensive fashion.  See 490 U.S. at 340; p.24, \nsupra. \nThese sensible principles laid down by this Court \nexplain why STB was well within its prerogative to \ndecline further study of downline accidents, Gulf \nCoast communities, or \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at yet-\nto-be-built oil wells that may be constructed as a result \nof the new rail.  Pet.App.66a.  At the end of the day, \nSTB is not in a position to regulate rail traffic, track \nsafety, refinery practices, or climate change.  Cf. \nJames W. Coleman, Beyond the Pipeline Wars: \nReforming Environmental Assessment of Energy \nTransport Infrastructure, 2018 Utah L. Rev. 119, 143 \n(2018) (\u201cIn practice, in unpredictably changing energy \nmarkets, it is nearly impossible to predict the \nupstream and downstream impact of a new pipeline \nproject.\u201d).  More to the point, regulation of those issues \nshould focus on ensuring the optimal rules for all track \nsafety and all refinery emissions, not obsessing about \nthe marginal contributions of 88 miles of new track in \nremote, rural Utah.   \nTo be sure, NEPA calls for inter-agency \nconsultation.  But that consultation should be brought \n\n46 \nto bear only on the problems that the proponent \nagency is supposed to study under NEPA.  There is a \nvast difference between consulting with the Forest \nService to determine the effects of a proposed rail \nroute that passes through a National Forest, see, e.g., \nPet.App.182a, and asking EPA to assess how 88 miles \nof additional track in Utah will contribute to climate \nchange based on refining activities on the Gulf Coast.  \nNEPA may require the former, but the rule of reason \nprotects an agency that declines to do the latter. \nThe same logic applies for STB\u2019s reasonable \ndecision to study potential ecological harms from the \nrailway, \nbut \nnot \npotential \nharms \nfrom \nnew \nconstruction that the new line may precipitate.  The \nextent to which one infrastructure project will spur \nsubsequent development is hard enough to predict for \nexperts in real estate or urban planning\u2014and STB is \nneither of those things.  And that is doubly true given \nthat, as even the D.C. Circuit admitted, there is \npresently no way to know with any reasonable degree \nof certainty where exactly in the 12,000-square-mile \nUinta Basin this new development will end up or how \nextensive it will be (if it ends up being built at all).  See \nPet.App.31a-34a. \n \nTo \nthe \nextent \nsome \nnew \ndevelopment materializes, there will be time enough \nfor the appropriate state or federal agencies to perform \ntheir respective statutory mandates to evaluate the \nenvironmental effects of a concrete proposal.  There is \nno need to burden a different agency now with an \nentirely predictive and potentially unnecessary \nhypothetical EIS.   \nSo too for train accidents.  As noted, STB did look \ninto the risks of increased accidents downline, but it \n\n47 \nstopped its NEPA review of the potential risks of \nadditional accidents the new railway could pose after \nconcluding that the risks were de minimis.  See pp.12-\n13, supra.  That is an eminently reasonable approach.  \nRail traffic safety is not a purely (or even \npredominantly) environmental issue.  While train \naccidents, like tanker-truck accidents, have the \npotential to cause environmental problems, the \nprincipal regulatory goal is to minimize all accidents \non the rails, whether cars are full or empty, or whether \nthey carry passengers, wheat, or waxy crude.  And, \nmore to the point, there is a federal agency with \nexpertise, authority, and responsibility for rail safety, \nand it is not STB, but the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (\u201cFRA\u201d), whose Administrator must \nhave \u201cprofessional experience in railroad safety, \nhazardous materials safety, or other transportation \nsafety.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); see p.10, supra.  If \nrespondents think FRA is falling down in its \nmanagement of the national rail system, that is a \nproblem whether or not there are 88 miles of \nadditional track in rural Utah, and they should \nchallenge the relevant FRA agency action.  What they \nshould not be allowed to do is tie the Uinta Basin \nRailway up in court indefinitely by bringing a NEPA \nclaim against STB concerning a de minimis risk. \nThat is especially true given STB\u2019s role in \nadministering a statute that puts a thumb on the scale \nin favor of rail construction.  STB is the successor \nagency to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Its \nmembers must have expertise in transportation and \nbusiness, not oil refining, ecology, or even train safety.  \nIts fundamental duty under 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901 is \n\u201cauthoriz[ing]\u201d rail line \u201cactivities \u2026 []consistent with \n\n48 \nthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d  Id. \u00a710901(c).  \nNeedless to say, any project that contributes to \ninterstate commerce could also be said to contribute to \nclimate change or increased traffic on the national \nrailway system.  While agencies can certainly study \nthe \nenvironmental \nrisks \nfrom \nsuch \nincreased \ncommercial activity, the rule of reason places \nreasonable limits on how much study is necessary and \nprevents NEPA from working at cross-purposes with \nthe basic pro-development mission of agencies like \nSTB. \nAs the decision below illustrates, however, the \nD.C. Circuit has replaced this Court\u2019s rule of reason \nwith a mandate to consider everything under the Sun.  \nIf an agency can block a project on the ground that it \n\u201cwould be too harmful to the environment,\u201d then (says \nthe D.C. Circuit) the agency must consider any and all \ndistant environmental effects the project may (or may \nnot) engender\u2014even if the agency has no role in \nregulating those effects, or the conditions that may \nmitigate or exacerbate them.  Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at \n1373.  So, here, the fact that STB can \u201cdeny\u201d the \npermit required for the rail project \u201con the ground that \nthe railway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other \ncosts outweigh its expected benefits\u201d meant that it \nmust consider \u201cthe climate effects of the combustion of \nthe fuel intended to be extracted\u201d\u2014even though STB \nhas zero authority to do anything about oil extraction, \nfuel combustion, or climate effects.  Pet.App.36a-37a, \n66a.  That is not a rule of reason; it is the opposite. \nThis Court long ago cautioned that NEPA \u201cshould \nnot be\u201d turned into \u201ca game\u201d in which environmental \ngroups and other opponents of progress \u201cengage in \n\n49 \nunjustified obstructionism\u201d by raising a laundry list of \nfar-flung effects that, in their view, \u201c\u2018ought to be\u2019 \nconsidered,\u201d no matter how long it takes and no matter \nwhether the agency doing the considering has any \npower to do anything about the supposed problems the \nproject poses.  Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 553-54.  The \nCourt doubled down on that view in Metropolitan \nEdison, emphasizing that policy disagreements should \nbe aired in \u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA\u201d \nlitigation.  460 U.S. at 777.  It bears emphasis that \nNEPA applies equally to legislative proposals and \nagency projects, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and yet \nlegislative proposals do not come encumbered with \n3,600-page EISs.  The explanation for that difference \nlies in the felt-need of agencies to paper the record in \nthe context of projects that can be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Congress recently made its views on the \npotential misuses and excesses of NEPA crystal clear.  \nSee Part I.B., supra.  Yet, as the decision below makes \nall too clear, the home court of appeals for most of the \nfederal alphabet soup agencies has not gotten the \nmessage.  This Court should set the record straight, \nreverse the decision below, and unshackle agencies \nand infrastructure-development projects from NEPA-\nlitigation purgatory. \nIII. The Court Should Confirm That STB\u2019s EIS \nSatisfies NEPA\u2019s Requirements. \nThis is hardly a case of an agency that \ngreenlighted \na \nproject \nheedless \nof \npotential \nenvironmental impacts.  The EIS here runs to 3,600 \npages.  It took years to prepare, and it reflects \nconsultation with sister agencies with expertise in \nparticular areas.  But all that was not remotely good \n\n50 \nenough for the D.C. Circuit, which demanded more \nspeculation and more exhaustive consideration of \nenvironmental (and non-environmental) risks that are \nremote in both time and geography and that implicate \nissues far outside STB\u2019s narrowly focused mandate.  \nSuch an approach threatens a project that promises to \nbring significant economic development to the Uinta \nBasin by connecting that remote area with the \nnational economy.   \nAnd the threat does not end there.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment demands investment, and investors \ndemand a degree of certainty and assurance that they \nwill not become victims of a regulatory rope-a-dope.  \nOpponents of development know full well that they do \nnot need to win every legal battle to prevail in the war \nof attrition.  The decision below is thus a threat not \njust \nto \nthe \npromising \nproject \nhere, \nbut \nto \ninfrastructure development in general. \nThe best way for this Court to send a clear signal \nthat such NEPA abuse will not be tolerated is to \naffirmatively hold that STB\u2019s EIS here passes NEPA \nmuster.  As the preceding discussion reveals, STB\u2019s \nEIS was comprehensive and thoroughgoing.  It readily \ncleared NEPA\u2019s minimum requirements, since it \nstudied all effects on the physical environment \nproximately caused by approving the railroad.  It even \nwent past proximate cause and discussed some remote \neffects and marginal risks like train accidents and \ndown-rail fires.  But that was gravy, not grounds for \nvacatur and additional study.  Although the court of \nappeals may have preferred that discussion to be more \nthorough, that is not the test.  There is no basis for \nreversing a favorable NEPA determination that \n\n51 \nconsiders all of the proximate environmental effects of \nthe proposed project, and the rule of reason protects \nagencies when they go further and consider some \nmarginal risks without exhaustively examining them \nor running down every rabbit hole.  Simply put, absent \na failure to consider an effect that is both proximate \nand environmental, 3,600 pages of EIS ought to be \nmore than enough. \nIn these circumstances, remanding the EIS to the \nagency \nwould \naccomplish \nnothing \nbut \nsowing \nadditional confusion and delay.  To give both \npetitioners and the people of the Uinta Basin the \ncertainty that they deserve, the Court should reverse \nwith language making clear that STB has no \nobligation to revisit its EIS on remand. \n\n52 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJAY C.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L.

These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

Understanding the executive branch's position, the specific precedents it relies on, and its arguments regarding administrative authority is critical to predicting how the Court, which often gives weight to the government's views in administrative law cases, will rule. This information is a core component of the legal analysis, making the task EIG extremely high.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action reinforces a fundamental and effective strategy: systematically gathering and analyzing the primary briefs from all principal parties. After reviewing the petition and the brief in opposition, examining the respondent's brief is the logical and necessary next step. This confirms the value of a structured, party-focused approach to information gathering in legal prediction tasks. While not a novel strategy, its consistent application is key to building a robust prediction model, yielding a moderate design EIG.",

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency was \nacting under a different and broader grant of statutory \nauthority that instructed the agency to consider \u201cthe \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).  The court found that, under that distinct provi-\nsion, the agency was permitted to \u201cdeny a pipeline cer-\ntificate on the ground that the pipeline would be too \nharmful to the environment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cPublic Citizen \nthus did not excuse FERC from considering these indi-\nrect effects.\u201d   Ibid. \nc. The court of appeals acted in accordance with \nthose decisions in this case when it determined that, be-\ncause of the scope of the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s statutory and regulatory authority, the Board \ncould not rely on Public Citizen as a basis for not con-\nsidering the environmental effects of increased oil drill-\ning and refining in its NEPA analysis.  Pet. App. 36a.  \nThe court did not dispute the principle that an agency \nneed not consider the environmental effects of develop-\nments that it \u201clacks authority to prevent, control, or \nmitigate.\u201d  Ibid.  The court instead found that principle \n\u201csimply inapplicable\u201d in light of the Board\u2019s statutory \nand regulatory authority.  Id. at 37a.  In the court\u2019s \nview, the governing framework\u2014including the Board\u2019s \nstatutory mandate \u201cto license railroad construction and \n\n14 \n \noperation based on the \u2018public convenience and neces-\nsity\u2019\u200a\u201d\u2014gave the Board \u201cthe authority to deny an  \nexemption to a railway project on the ground that the \nrailway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs \noutweigh its expected benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted). \n2. Petitioners are therefore mistaken in asserting \n(Pet. 20) that there is a \u201csharp split between the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s reading of Public Citizen and the reading em-\nployed by the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Elev-\nenth Circuits.\u201d  All of those courts recognize that, be-\ncause Public Citizen held that an agency need not con-\nsider environmental effects it cannot prevent, the scope \nof the requisite NEPA analysis will depend on the scope \nof the particular agency\u2019s statutory and regulatory au-\nthority.  And while the D.C. Circuit has sometimes \nfound that Public Citizen does not excuse an agency\u2019s \nfailure to consider certain environmental effects, it has \ndone so based on its understanding of the breadth of the \nagency\u2019s authority in the particular case, not a disagree-\nment regarding Public Citizen\u2019s holding.   \nPetitioners\u2019 assertion to the contrary is based pri-\nmarily (Pet. 18-19) on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criticism of \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail, but that crit-\nicism does not establish an inter-circuit conflict because \nthe Eleventh Circuit described Sabal Trail as \u201cat odds \nwith earlier D.C. Circuit cases correctly\u201d recognizing \nthe limits on the environmental analysis NEPA re-\nquires.  Center For Biological Diversity, 941 F.3d at \n1300.  Therefore, at most, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criti-\ncism suggests an intra-circuit conflict that would not \nwarrant this Court\u2019s intervention.  Wisniewski v. \nUnited States, 353 U.S. 901, 902 (1957) (per curiam) (\u201cIt \n\n15 \n \nis primarily the task of a Court of Appeals to reconcile \nits internal difficulties.\u201d).   \nIn any event, while the Eleventh Circuit criticized \nSabal Trail for \u201cfail[ing] to take seriously the rule of \nreason announced in Public Citizen,\u201d in the very next \nparagraph, the Eleventh Circuit described that \u201crule of \nreason\u201d as dictating that \u201cagencies are not required to \nconsider effects that they lack the statutory authority \ncategorically to prevent.\u201d  Center for Biological Diver-\nsity, 941 F.3d at 1300.  Neither Sabal Trail nor the de-\ncision below purported to reject that principle.  Instead, \nboth held that\u2014because the governing statutory provi-\nsions gave the agency the authority to consider and dis-\napprove the relevant project based on the increased \nharm to the environment that the project would cause\u2014\nthe agency had the statutory authority to prevent that \nincreased harm.  See Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at 1373; Pet. \nApp. 37a.   \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 20) that differ-\nences in the governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork \u201ccannot account for the circuits\u2019 conflicting inter-\npretations\u201d because the Corps of Engineers in the other \ndecisions had \u201cjust as much power\u201d as the agencies in \nSabal Trail and the decision below.  The Eleventh Cir-\ncuit itself held otherwise, recognizing that Sabal Trail \nwas distinguishable from its own decision in Center for \nBiological Diversity because, among other things, \u201cthe \nagency\u2019s statutory authority in Sabal Trail was much \nbroader than the Corps\u2019 here.\u201d  941 F.3d at 1299.   \nPetitioners also err in asserting (Pet. 19) that the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s decision in Center for Biological Diver-\nsity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723 (2020), suggests disa-\ngreement in the circuits regarding Public Citizen\u2019s \nmeaning.  The main NEPA challenge in that case \n\n16 \n \ninvolved whether it was technically feasible for the \nagency to quantify emissions resulting from the foreign \nconsumption of oil.  Id. at 737-740.  The court cited and \ndescribed the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail in \njustifying its conclusion that an agency may not excuse \nits failure to assess the environmental effects of \u201cindi-\nrect greenhouse gas emissions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s \nneed to make \u201cassumptions\u201d in order to estimate those \neffects.  Id. at 737.  The Ninth Circuit did not discuss \neither Public Citizen or Sabal Trail\u2019s treatment of that \ncase, mentioning Public Citizen only in a \u201ccf.\u201d cite to a \nsentence stating that the agency \u201cha[d] the statutory \nauthority to act on the emissions resulting from foreign \noil consumption.\u201d  Id. at 740.   \n3. Petitioners\u2019 other arguments in support of review \nlack merit, and this case would be a poor vehicle even if \nthe Court was inclined to consider the question pre-\nsented.   \na. Petitioners contend (Pet. 21-23) that the decision \nbelow warrants this Court\u2019s intervention because the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s approach to Public Citizen turns agen-\ncies into \u201cenvironmental-policy czars.\u201d  Pet. 22 (citation \nand emphasis omitted).  But the decision below merely \nfound that the Board had the statutory authority to con-\nsider the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining, Pet. App. 36a, and remanded to the Board \nso that it could either analyze those effects or \u201cexplain \nin more detail\u201d why it could not identify and quantify \nthem, Id. at 34a (citation omitted); see id. at 35a (hold-\ning that the Board had not \u201cadequately explain[ed] why \nit could not employ\u201d forecasting and other methods to \nestimate those effects).  The decision therefore does not \nrequire the Board to refuse to authorize the railway \nbased on the environmental effects of increased oil \n\n17 \n \ndrilling and refining, and it does not even require the \nBoard to consider those effects if it can adequately ex-\nplain why their consideration is not feasible.   \nMoreover, petitioners do not challenge the court of \nappeals\u2019 understanding of the Board\u2019s statutory author-\nity to deny an exemption based on the relevant environ-\nmental effects.  Rather, petitioners state that the court \n\u201cwas right\u201d to find \u201cthat the Board could decline the \nproject \u2018if the environmental harm caused by the rail-\nway outweigh[ed] its transportation benefits.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 23 \n(quoting Pet. App. 36a) (brackets in original).  And pe-\ntitioners do not contend that there is any disagreement \nin the courts of appeals regarding that conclusion. \nb. Petitioners also assert (Pet. 24-25) that the Court \nshould grant review because in 2022 the Council on En-\nvironmental Quality (CEQ) issued regulations address-\ning the appropriate scope of NEPA review.  See 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453 (Apr. 20, 2022).  Petitioners maintain (Pet. \n24) that the Federal Register notice accompanying the \n2022 rules contains an analysis of Public Citizen that \ndiffers from that reflected in the CEQ\u2019s 2020 regula-\ntions, 85 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (July 16, 2020).  The court of \nappeals\u2019 decision, however, does not analyze or discuss \neither the 2022 or 2020 regulations, because the Board\u2019s \nNEPA analysis was performed \u201cunder pre-2020 regula-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a.  And those intervening regulatory \ndevelopments, as well as a further set of relevant regu-\nlations released by the CEQ earlier this month, 89 Fed. \nReg. 35,442 (May 1, 2024), provide an additional reason \nto deny certiorari, because the circuits have not yet had \nan opportunity to assess whether or how the new regu-\nlations may affect their approach.   \nc. This case would also be a poor vehicle for review \nbecause the holding that is the subject of this petition \n\n18 \n \nwas just one of several independent holdings adverse to \nthe Board and the federal government.  In assessing the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA compliance, the court of appeals also \nheld that the Board had failed to adequately analyze \nthree other environmental effects (downline rail acci-\ndents, risks and impacts of wildfires, and impacts on wa-\nter resources).  Pet. App. 40a-47a.  Those holdings \nwould not be affected by the resolution of the question \npresented, and the same is true with respect to the \ncourt\u2019s holdings regarding the flaws in the Fish and \nWildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion, and some of the de-\nfects the court identified in the Board\u2019s application of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act.  See id. at 57a-69a.  Be-\ncause of these additional deficiencies, id. at 70a, the \nBoard and the Fish and Wildlife Service would be re-\nquired to issue revised decisions regardless of the out-\ncome of this petition.   \nd. Finally, this case would be an unsuitable vehicle \nbecause petitioners did not challenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nunderstanding of Public Citizen before the court of ap-\npeals.  While the Board relied on Public Citizen in ex-\nplaining the scope of its NEPA analysis, Pet. App. 135a, \npetitioners did not discuss or even cite that case in their \npanel briefing.  See C.A. Doc. 1990837 (Mar. 20, 2023).  \nAnd their petition for rehearing en banc likewise did not \ndiscuss Public Citizen or suggest that the panel\u2019s un-\nderstanding of that decision implicated or created a di-\nvision in the circuits.  See C.A. Doc. 2019520 (Sept. 29, \n2023).  Instead, petitioners argued that the panel\u2019s \nNEPA analysis conflicted with other D.C. Circuit deci-\nsions.  See id. at 9-13.  Accordingly, the court of appeals \ndid not have an opportunity to consider petitioners\u2019 ar-\nguments regarding the proper application of Public Cit-\nizen, and this Court should not do so in the first \n\n19 \n \ninstance.  Cf. Byrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, 404 \n(2018) (observing that \u201cit is generally unwise\u201d for this \nCourt \u201cto consider arguments in the first instance\u201d).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

The division of argument time will \nensure that both sets of respondents\u2014one a local government in an area where \nparticular environmental effects of the proposed railway will be felt; the other, a \ngroup of environmental organizations with deep expertise in and commitment to the \nlegal issues at stake in this case, representing people who will also feel the \nenvironmental effects\u2014can adequately present their own distinct perspectives and \nrepresent their own interests.   \n1. \nThis case involves a challenge under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) to an order of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) \nauthorizing the construction and operation of a new rail line in the Uinta Basin in \n \n1  \nThe United States and other federal entities are also respondents, but have filed \na brief supporting petitioners as to the disposition of this case (though \ndisagreeing with aspects of petitioners\u2019 reasoning).  We understand that the \nSolicitor General intends to file a motion to share time with petitioners and does \nnot seek any portion of respondents\u2019 time. \n\n \n3 \nUtah that will primarily be used to take new crude oil produced in the Basin to \nmarket. \n2. \nBelow, Eagle County and Environmental Respondents filed separate \npetitions for review of the Board\u2019s order in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.  The court of appeals consolidated the two petitions \nand heard the cases together.  Pet. App. 13a.  Before the court of appeals, although \nEagle County and the Environmental Respondents both argued that the Board had \nviolated NEPA, they raised related but distinct points in support of their \narguments.  \n3. \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals ultimately agreed with a subset \nof the arguments raised by Eagle County and, separately, a subset of the arguments \nraised by Environmental Respondents.  It therefore granted the petitions in part, \nvacated the Board\u2019s order as arbitrary and capricious, and remanded the matter to \nthe Board for further proceedings.   \n4. \nThis Court granted certiorari to address the question whether NEPA \n\u201crequires an agency to study environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of \nthe action over which the agency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i. \n5. \nDivided argument is appropriate here because respondents have \ndistinct perspectives on the question presented, which they have articulated in two \nseparate briefs.  This Court often grants divided argument when two sets of parties \nwith their own counsel each file separate briefs emphasizing different arguments in \nsupport of the same overarching disposition.  See, e.g., Fulton v. City of \n\n \n4 \nPhiladelphia, No. 19-123, 141 S. Ct. 230 (Oct. 5, 2020); Kelly v. United States, No. \n18-1059, 140 S. Ct. 661 (Dec. 16, 2019); Rucho v. Common Cause, No. 18-422, 139 S. \nCt. 1316 (Mar. 15, 2019); McDonald v. City of Chicago, No. 08-1521, 130 S. Ct. 1317  \n(Jan. 25, 2010).     \n6. \nEagle County\u2019s brief emphasizes the aspect of this case in which Eagle \nCounty has a strong and local interest:  the Board\u2019s arbitrary discussion of \n\u201cdownline\u201d environmental effects stemming from the substantial increase in train \ntraffic on an existing rail line in Colorado, which passes through Eagle County.  The \nEnvironmental Respondents emphasize the Board\u2019s failure to consider \nenvironmental effects stemming from increased production of crude oil in the Basin \nand from refining that crude.  The distinction between these different sets of \nenvironmental effects is important because the Board and the court of appeals took \ndifferent approaches to these issues below.  The Board did not consider certain \nenvironmental effects of the increased production of Basin crude and refining of \nBasin crude, and the court of appeals held that its explanation for not doing so was \ninsufficient.  The Board did evaluate downline effects in Colorado, though its \nanalysis failed to comply with NEPA.  Eagle County\u2019s brief also explains why the \ndownline effects are not properly part of the case before this Court given the way \npetitioners chose to present the case at the certiorari stage. \n7. \nThis Court has also routinely allowed divided argument when, as here, \na government entity and a private party are on the same side of a dispute.  That \npractice recognizes that governmental parties have distinct interests that would be \n\n \n5 \nmore difficult for a private organization to represent.  See, e.g., Am. Legion v. Am. \nHumanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717, 139 S. Ct. 951 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2019) (dividing \nargument between the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission \nand private petitioners); see also Dep\u2019t of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966, 139 S. \nCt. 1543 (Apr. 12, 2019) (state and private petitioners); Tennessee Wine & Spirits \nAss\u2019n v. Blair, No. 18-96, 139 S. Ct. 783 (Jan. 4, 2019) (state and private petitioner); \nMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, No. 16-111, 138 S. Ct. 466 \n(Nov. 21, 2017) (state agency and private respondents).  As a local government, \nEagle County has a unique perspective on the importance of NEPA for states and \nlocalities.     \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, Eagle County and the Environmental Respondents \nrespectfully request that the Court permit divided argument. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKirti Datla \n     Counsel of Record \nBenjamin Chagnon \nEARTHJUSTICE \n1001 G Street, NW, Suite 1000 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nkdatla@earthjustice.org  \n(202) 797-5241 \n \nCounsel for Environmental  \nRespondents \n \nWilliam M.

The Solicitor General requests the following division \nof argument time:  15 minutes for petitioners, 15 minutes for the \nfederal \nrespondents \nsupporting \npetitioners. \n \nCounsel \nfor \npetitioners has agreed to that allocation. \nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. \nNo. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), \u201cdeclare[d] a \nnational policy,\u201d intended to \u201cencourage productive and enjoyable \nharmony between man and his environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4321.  NEPA\u2019s \n\n2 \n \ncore procedural mandate requires federal agencies to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement in connection with a proposal for \n\u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).   \nPetitioners Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and Uinta \nBasin Railway, LLC filed an application with the Surface \nTransportation Board (Board) to authorize the construction of a \nrailway line connecting the Uinta Basin with the national rail \nnetwork in Utah.  Pet. App. 6a.  The Board prepared an \nenvironmental impact statement analyzing a range of potential \nenvironmental consequences of the project before ultimately \ndeciding to authorize the railway line.  Id. at 6a-13a.  The non-\nfederal respondents filed petitions for review in the court of \nappeals \nchallenging \nthe \nBoard\u2019s \nNEPA \nanalysis \nunder \nthe \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 706(a)(2).  Id. at \n13a.  Petitioners intervened in support of the Board.  See id. at \n6a.   \nThe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \npartially \nvacated \nthe \nBoard\u2019s \nenvironmental impact statement.  Pet. App. 70a.  The court held \nthat the Board had adopted an unduly limited view of the scope of \nenvironmental impacts the Board was required to analyze, \nconcluding that the statement should have included additional \nanalysis of the upstream environmental effects of increased oil \nproduction in the Uinta Basin following completion of the new \nrailway line and the localized downstream effects of ultimately \n\n3 \n \nprocessing some of that oil in refineries in Texas and Louisiana.  \nPet. App. 28a-37a.  The court also found several flaws in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the downline effects of possible rail accidents \nand wildfires, as well as in its analysis of the potential harms \nto downline water resources.  See Pet. App. 40a-47a.   \nPetitioner then sought review in this Court, which granted \ncertiorari.  The federal respondents have filed an opening brief \non the merits supporting petitioners.   \nDividing \nthe \nargument \ntime \nfor \npetitioners \nbetween \npetitioners and the federal respondents supporting petitioners \nwould be of material assistance to this Court.  The federal \ngovernment has a substantial interest in this case because it \ninvolves a challenge to an environmental impact statement prepared \nby the Board, which is a federal agency, and because the question \npresented concerns the proper interpretation and application of a \nfederal environmental statute that applies to \u201call agencies of the \nFederal Government.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332.  Petitioners of course have \na substantial interest in this case because the partial vacatur of \nthe Board\u2019s environmental impact statement is an impediment to the \nconstruction of the new railway line that the Board authorized.   \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

AFRC \nrepresents more than 50 forest product businesses \nand \nforest \nlandowners \nthroughout \nOregon, \nWashington, California, Nevada, Idaho and Montana.  \nIt promotes active management to attain productive \npublic forests, protect the value and integrity of \nadjoining private forests, and support the economic \nand social foundations of local communities.  And it \nworks to improve federal and state laws, regulations, \npolicies and decisions regarding access to and \nmanagement of public forest lands and protection of \nall forest lands. \nThis case crystallizes an issue that has \nfrustrated AFRC and its members for years.  AFRC \nand its members understand that in the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), Congress required \nfederal regulators to pause and think critically about \nwhat effects the regulators\u2019 decisions would have on \n \n1 Per Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the undersigned affirms that no \ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \nsuch counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of the brief.  And as required \nby Rule 37.2, amicus\u2019s counsel notified counsel of record for all \nparties of amicus\u2019s intention to file this brief at least 10 days \nprior to the due date for the brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nthe \u201chuman environment,\u201d specifically \u201cto create and \nmaintain conditions under which man and nature can \nexist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, \neconomic, and other requirements of present and \nfuture generations of Americans.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a) \n(emphasis added); see also id. \u00a7 4332(C) (clarifying \nthat the focus is not on the \u201cenvironment\u201d for the \nenvironment\u2019s own sake, but on the \u201chuman \nenvironment\u201d).   \nCongress has required federal regulators \u201cto \ntake environmental consequences into account in \ntheir decisionmaking . . . eliminating the excuse . . . \noffered by bureaucrats that their statutory authority \ndid not authorize consideration of such factors in their \npolicy decisions.\u201d  Scenic Hudson Pres. Conf. v. Fed. \nPower Comm\u2019n, 407 U.S. 926, 927 (1972) (Douglas, J., \ndissenting from denial of certiorari).     \nAFRC and its members know, just as the \nSurface Transportation Board clearly knows, that the \nBoard and other federal regulators must take \nenvironmental consequences into account when \nmaking decisions.  They also know that Congress \nrequired proof that the federal regulators paused to \nconsider \nand \nexplain \nwhat \nenvironmental \nconsequences they had considered, and how they had \ndone so.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C).   \nBut that is all Congress demanded.  Yet as the \nlone dissenter at the Board and the lower court here \nhave \nshown, \nmany \njudges \nreviewing \nfederal \nregulators\u2019 \nactions \nhave \nevidently \nconsidered \nCongress\u2019s requirement as a point of departure\u2014\n\n3 \n \n \n \npreferring instead to read their own environmental-\npolicy preferences into their duties to assess whether \nfederal regulators considered and explained the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions. \nTake what has happened here:  Congress has \ncreated a presumption that constructing rail lines is \nin the public interest; the Surface Transportation \nBoard received an application to construct a rail line \nthat would be in the public interest\u2014including the \ninterest of communities that have been and would \notherwise continue to be left behind by successive \nPresidential Administrations; and then the Board \nspent years and many pages examining and \nexplaining the potential environmental consequences \nof constructing and operating the rail line.  In this \ncase, the federal regulators did what Congress \nrequired. \nBut for decades, the lower federal courts have \nlet \u201canti-use\u201d groups who disregard Congress\u2019s role in \nexpressing the public interest\u2014like the plaintiffs who \nsued here\u2014use NEPA as a weapon to prevent any \nfederal approvals of projects that would \u201ccreate and \nmaintain conditions under which man and nature can \nexist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, \neconomic, and other requirements of present and \nfuture generations of Americans.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4331(a).  Rather than be satisfied that the federal \nregulators have done their jobs and the public interest \ncan be realized, these groups and the federal courts \nthat enable them now \u201cflyspeck\u201d environmental \nexplanations, inventing supposed errors so they can \npromote their preferred outcomes.   \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCongress does not allow the anti-use groups \nand lower courts to do that\u2014the courts\u2019 task is not to \n\u201cflyspeck an agency\u2019s environmental analysis, looking \nfor any deficiency no matter how minor.\u201d  Nevada v. \nDep\u2019t of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  The \ncourts can only \u201capply a rule of reason standard \n(essentially an abuse of discretion standard) in \ndeciding \nwhether \nclaimed \ndeficiencies \nin \n[an \nenvironmental-consequences explanation] are merely \nflyspecks, or are significant enough to defeat the goals \nof informed decisionmaking and informed public \ncomment.\u201d  Utahns for Better Transp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nTransp., 305 F.3d 1152, 1163 (10th Cir. 2002).  An \nagency like the Board must be reasonable in \nconsidering \nand \nexplaining \nthe \nenvironmental \nconsequences of approving construction of a rail line \nthat is in the public interest; the federal regulators do \nnot have to be perfect.  FCC v. Prometheus Radio \nProject, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021); Marsh v. Oregon \nNat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 377 (1989). \nThe way the lower courts and other unelected \npersons have weaponized NEPA as an \u201canti-use\u201d \nauthority ignores\u2014or rejects\u2014the public interest.  \nAnd that practice is detrimental to AFRC and its \nmembers.  As an analogy to the rail line at issue here, \nCongress has declared in multiple statutes, such as \nthe Federal Land Policy and Management Act, that \nactive \nforest \nmanagement, \nincluding \ntimber \nharvesting, is in the public interest.  Yet when federal \nregulators approve timber-harvesting and related \nprojects and examine and explain the environmental \nconsequences of those approvals, the anti-use groups \nand many lower courts have weaponized NEPA to \n\n5 \n \n \n \nflyspeck the regulators\u2019 explanations and promote \ntheir own substantive results, which are often to \ncancel or at least greatly delay projects.  That is what \nthe plaintiffs, the lone dissenter at the Board, and the \nlower court did here.  But it must stop. \nAFRC is determined to stop this practice.  \nAFRC has publicly commented that the NEPA process \nhas \u201cunnecessarily slowed forest management and \nfire prevention projects on public lands [because] the \nlengthy timeframes required to complete an EIS and \nissue a Record of Decision [now] average . . . 4.5 years, \nand one quarter of EISs took more than 6 years.\u201d  See \nAFRC CEQ Comment 4.2  The ever-growing urgency \nto address forest health shows how the misguided\u2014\nand unlawful\u2014weaponization of NEPA continues to \nharm groups across many industries and the Country \nby preventing the realization of the public interest.   \nWhich begs the question in the light as AFRC \nsees it:  how will the public\u2019s interest in active forest \nmanagement be realized in the face of the \u201cthousands \nof NEPA lawsuits, many of which delay or kill federal \nprojects\u201d like the rail line in this case?  See AFRC CEQ \nComment 4.  Unfortunately, the anti-use groups like \n \n2 AFRC submitted the cited comment in response to the Council \non Environmental Quality\u2019s notice of proposed rulemaking to \nrevise NEPA regulations, which was published in the Federal \nRegister at 86 Fed. Reg. 55,757 (Oct. 7, 2021), and which had the \ndocket number CEQ-2021-0002.   \nAFRC\u2019s comment is located in the regulatory docket at docket-\nidentification number CEQ-2021-0002-39296, and it can be \naccessed online at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CEQ-\n2021-0002-39296 (last visited Apr. 4, 2024). \n\n6 \n \n \n \nthe plaintiffs here, the lone dissenter at the Board, \nand the lower court have decided that their interests \nare superior to the public interest, and they have no \nproblem leaving the rest of the Country behind. \nAFRC\u2019s members are no strangers to being \u201cleft \nbehind\u201d by federal actors even though Congress has \ngiven clear instructions about the public interest.

It evaluated the potential environmental \nconsequences potentially related to authorizing \nconstruction and operation of a rail line.  It explained \nall those issues in a detailed statement.  Yet the lower \ncourt ignored Congress and imposed its own priorities \nas superior to the public interest.   \n\n7 \n \n \n \nThis madness of requiring more\u2014weaponizing \nNEPA\u2014to prevent any uses of public lands must end.  \nAnd AFRC respectfully submits this brief asking the \nCourt to step in, review this case, and correct the \nundemocratic, unlawful path that many federal \nregulators and lower courts have taken. \n\u2666 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen it comes to building rail lines, Congress \nhas been clear about the public interest:  there is a \nrebuttable presumption that building a rail line is in \nthe public interest as long as the federal agency \nreviewing the proposal to build the line\u2014the Surface \nTransportation Board\u2014takes a \u201chard look\u201d at the \npotential environmental consequences of building it.  \nThat\u2019s what the Board did here. \nIn contrast, the court below and the lone \ndissenter at the Board would reverse the order, \nsupposedly because their shared idea of \u201cwhat is in \nthe public interest\u201d is superior to Congress\u2019s clear \nstatement of that interest.  The lone dissenter went \nfurther, asserting that he alone knows that \n\u201cDecarbonization is national policy\u201d and that is \nthe public interest, Pet.App.146a (emphasis in \noriginal)\u2014never mind what Congress says.   \nThere is a troubling trend in which the lower \ncourts are using NEPA to put their interests or other \nanti-use groups\u2019 interests over the public interest.  \nBut at least with respect to building rail lines, two \n\n8 \n \n \n \ncircuit courts have been clear that building them is \npresumptively in the public interest.  The fact that the \nlower court here got the public\u2019s interest backward, in \nconflict with other circuit courts, is sufficient reason \nfor this Court to review the lower court\u2019s decision.  See \nRule 10(a).   \nTo make the matter worse, the lower court \ndisregarded this Court\u2019s explanation in Department of \nTransportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), \nof how an agency takes a \u201chard look\u201d at the potential \nenvironmental consequences of an action when the \nagency cannot directly regulate those environmental \nconsequences, further justifying the Court\u2019s review of \nthe lower court\u2019s decision.  See Rule 10(c). \nThe lower court prevented construction of a \nmuch-needed rail line based on an overreaching \nconclusion that the Surface Transportation Board did \nnot \nperform \nan \nadequate \nanalysis \nof \nthe \nenvironmental consequences that building and \noperating the rail line might, potentially, maybe could \nhave, and even though the Board could do nothing to \nregulate those consequences.  But the lower court \nwent so far down the path of looking for things to \ncriticize that it lost the forest for the trees.   \nThe lower court\u2019s confusion (or, less charitably, \nits desire to prevent the rail line) misses the point:  the \nBoard followed NEPA because it made the detailed \nstatement that Congress required it to make about \nenvironmental consequences.  The Board acted \nreasonably and otherwise lawfully.  The lower court\u2019s \n\n9 \n \n \n \ncontrary approach to NEPA hurts not only those \nrelying on the rail line but also AFRC and its members \nwho are trying to realize the public\u2019s interest in active \nforest management. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nCongress has decided that building rail \nlines is in the public interest. \nCongress has spoken clearly:  the presumption \nis that building rail lines is in the public interest, and \nthe Surface Transportation Board should approve \nsuch construction accordingly.  As Congress said it, \n\u201cThe Board shall issue a certificate authorizing \nactivities for which such authority is requested in an \napplication . . . unless the Board finds that such \nactivities are inconsistent with the public convenience \nand necessity.  Such certificate may approve the \napplication as filed, or with modifications, and may \nrequire compliance with conditions . . . the Board finds \nnecessary in the public interest.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(c) \n(emphasis added). \nAt least two circuit courts agree that \u201cthere is a \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved.\u201d  Mid States Coal. for Progress v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) \n(emphasis added); N. Plains Res. Council v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 668 F.3d 1067, 1092 (9th Cir. 2011); see \nalso Lebron v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. \n374, 383\u201384 (1995) (\u201cCongress established Amtrak in \norder to avert the threatened extinction of passenger \ntrains in the United States.  The statute that created \n\n10 \n \n \n \nit begins with the congressional finding, redolent of \nprovisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, see, e.g., \n49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10901, 10903, 10922 . . . that \u2018the public \nconvenience and necessity require the continuance \nand improvement\u2019 of railroad passenger service.\u201d). \nThis congressional preference is important to \nAFRC because Congress has also spoken clearly that \nactive forest management, which includes timber \nharvesting and is vital to AFRC\u2019s members, is in the \npublic interest.  For example, we know from Congress \nthat it is in the public interest that federal agencies \nmanage \u201cpublic lands\u201d \u201cin a manner which recognizes \nthe Nation\u2019s need for domestic sources of . . . timber . \n. . from the public lands.\u201d  43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a)(12) \n(emphasis added).  And Congress emphasized that \nfederal agencies must explain themselves to Congress \nwhen they try to eliminate \u201ctimber production\u201d from \nfederal lands.  43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1702(l) (\u201ctimber \nproduction\u201d is a \u201cprincipal or major use\u201d of federal \nlands), 1712(e)(1)\u2013(2) (heightened scrutiny given to \nfederal management decisions that eliminate a \n\u201cprincipal or major use\u201d of federal lands). \nAlong similar lines, Congress has required \ndetailed planning for and protection of timber \nharvesting \u201c[i]n recognition of the vital importance \nof America\u2019s renewable resources of the forest . . . to \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nsocial \nand \neconomic \nwell-being.\u201d  \n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a) (emphasis added).3  So AFRC is \n \n3 And when Congress created a multiple-use policy for the \nnational forests, it included timber harvesting as an important \nuse, rather than exclude timber harvesting in favor of anti-use \n(or, pristine preservation) purposes.  16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 528, 531. \n\n11 \n \n \n \nvery troubled by the approach that the Surface \nTransportation Board\u2019s lone dissenter and the lower \ncourt took in this case.  At best, they disregarded the \npublic interest in favor of their own goals.  Worse, they \nused NEPA as a weapon against the public interest.  \nBut that is not what Congress intended in NEPA. \nII. \nCongress conditioned the public interest \non a requirement to take a \u201chard look\u201d at \npotential environmental consequences. \nIn NEPA, Congress did not contemplate that a \nfederal court or an unelected bureaucrat would be able \nto cancel (either directly or by indefinite delay) federal \napprovals of the projects that serve the public \ninterest.  Instead, when a federal agency decides that \nits proposed action\u2014here, approving construction of a \nrail line\u2014will \u201csignificantly affect[] the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d then it must describe in detail \nthe \u201cenvironmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \n\u201cany adverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided should the proposal be implemented.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C)(i)\u2013(ii).   \nThe role for the court is to ensure that the \nagency has taken a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental \nconsequences.  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, \n410 n.21 (1976).  A court cannot interject itself within \nthe agency\u2019s discretion as to the choice of the action.  \nId.  At most, Congress put the courts in the position of \ndeciding whether agency actions are \u201creasonable and \nreasonably explained.\u201d  Prometheus Radio Project, 592 \nU.S. at 423. \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThat is where the lower court went wrong here.  \nIt took the question of \u201cwhat is reasonable,\u201d and it \nused that question as a point of departure.  To its \ncredit, the lower court did mention the point that \nwhen an agency\u2014here, the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2014is trying to look at and explain environmental \nconsequences of a proposed action, then \u201creasonable\u201d \nis \u201cthe operative word.\u201d  Pet.App.32a.  But then the \nlower court got off-track. \nThe concept of what is \u201creasonable\u201d is one that \ncomes up often and which this Court has addressed in \nmany contexts, including in cases arising (ultimately, \nas this one does) under the Administrative Procedure \nAct.4  E.g., Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 427\u2013\n28 (\u201cIn light of the sparse record on minority and \nfemale ownership and the FCC\u2019s findings with respect \nto competition, localism, and viewpoint diversity, we \ncannot say that the agency\u2019s decision to repeal or \nmodify the ownership rules fell outside the zone of \nreasonableness for purposes of the APA.\u201d).  But the \nlower courts are not listening to this Court.  On the \nsurface, they acknowledge that \u201creasonable\u201d is the \nrequirement, but then they go way further so that \nthey can prevent projects that they do not like. \nUsing this case as an example, the lower court \nacknowledged \u201creasonable\u201d as its lodestar, see \nPet.App.32a, but then the court went off the rails.   \n \n4 Prometheus Radio Project might be especially on point for its \nrole in working through a case about what is reasonable for an \nagency to do when Congress has explained what is in the public \ninterest.  See id. \n\n13 \n \n \n \na. \nThe lower court misapplied Public \nCitizen\u2019s \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d \nanalysis. \nThere are many ways the lower court could \nhave found some outer limit of what would have been \n\u201creasonable\u201d for the Surface Transportation Board to \ndo in this case.  Petitioners have focused on one, \nPet. 14, and that one is sufficient for the Court\u2019s \nreview of this case.   \nIn Department of Transportation v. Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004), the Court rejected \n\u201ca particularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a \ncause of an environmental effect even when the \nagency has no authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  As \nparticularly relevant to this case, the Court examined \nwhether NEPA required a federal agency to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of cross-border operations of \nMexican-domiciled motor carriers, where the agency\u2019s \npromulgation of certain regulations would allow such \ncross-border operations to occur.  Id. at 756.   \nThe answer was \u201cno,\u201d NEPA did not require the \nagency to evaluate those effects because they were out \nof the agency\u2019s control, even though the agency\u2019s \naction \u201cwould allow\u201d the activities that could result \nin environmental consequences.  Id. at 756, 767\u201368 \n(emphasis added).  Why?  Because lacking the ability \nto directly regulate the activities\u2014less speculative \nthere \nthan \nin \nthis \ncase\u2014that \nwould \nhave \nenvironmental consequences, the agency properly \nrealized that those consequences simply were not \n\n14 \n \n \n \nrelevant to its decision whether to act.  The agency \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on whatever \ninformation\u201d it allegedly should have considered and \nexplained to the public.  Id. at 768.5 \nThe same principle applies here:  lacking the \nability to directly regulate any future \u201cupstream\u201d oil \nand gas production from federal, private, or state \nminerals in the Uinta Basin and lacking the ability to \ndirectly regulate any future \u201cdownstream\u201d processing \nof oil and gas at refineries (whether in any of various \nregions of the Country or, potentially, somewhere else \nin the world), the Surface Transportation Board \nproperly realized that those entirely speculative \nenvironmental consequences were not relevant to its \ndecision whether to approve construction of the rail \nline\u2014even, as was true in Public Citizen, if the \n \n5 Contra Mid States Coal. for Progress, 345 F.3d at 548\u201351 (8th \nCir. 2003)\u2014while AFRC agrees with the circuit court\u2019s \nexplanation in Mid States Coal. for Progress that rail \nconstruction presumptively is in the public interest, supra p. 9, \nAFRC disagrees with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Surface \nTransportation Board erred in that case by refusing to speculate \nwhether construction of the rail line might, potentially, maybe \nlead to increased demand for coal (or supply of coal) and even \nmore speculative increases in air pollutants.   \nAs the circuit \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This case is scheduled for oral argument on December 10, 2024.  Eagle \nCounty and the Environmental Respondents propose to divide respondents\u2019 time \nequally, with fifteen minutes for Eagle County and fifteen minutes for \nEnvironmental Respondents.1  Granting this motion therefore would not require the \nCourt to enlarge the scheduled time for argument, and the Court has not scheduled \nanother case for argument on the same day.  The division of argument time will \nensure that both sets of respondents\u2014one a local government in an area where \nparticular environmental effects of the proposed railway will be felt; the other, a \ngroup of environmental organizations with deep expertise in and commitment to the \nlegal issues at stake in this case, representing people who will also feel the \nenvironmental effects\u2014can adequately present their own distinct perspectives and \nrepresent their own interests.   \n1. \nThis case involves a challenge under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) to an order of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) \nauthorizing the construction and operation of a new rail line in the Uinta Basin in \n \n1  \nThe United States and other federal entities are also respondents, but have filed \na brief supporting petitioners as to the disposition of this case (though \ndisagreeing with aspects of petitioners\u2019 reasoning).  We understand that the \nSolicitor General intends to file a motion to share time with petitioners and does \nnot seek any portion of respondents\u2019 time. \n\n \n3 \nUtah that will primarily be used to take new crude oil produced in the Basin to \nmarket. \n2. \nBelow, Eagle County and Environmental Respondents filed separate \npetitions for review of the Board\u2019s order in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.  The court of appeals consolidated the two petitions \nand heard the cases together.  Pet. App. 13a.  Before the court of appeals, although \nEagle County and the Environmental Respondents both argued that the Board had \nviolated NEPA, they raised related but distinct points in support of their \narguments.  \n3. \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals ultimately agreed with a subset \nof the arguments raised by Eagle County and, separately, a subset of the arguments \nraised by Environmental Respondents.  It therefore granted the petitions in part, \nvacated the Board\u2019s order as arbitrary and capricious, and remanded the matter to \nthe Board for further proceedings.   \n4. \nThis Court granted certiorari to address the question whether NEPA \n\u201crequires an agency to study environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of \nthe action over which the agency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i. \n5. \nDivided argument is appropriate here because respondents have \ndistinct perspectives on the question presented, which they have articulated in two \nseparate briefs.  This Court often grants divided argument when two sets of parties \nwith their own counsel each file separate briefs emphasizing different arguments in \nsupport of the same overarching disposition.  See, e.g., Fulton v. City of \n\n \n4 \nPhiladelphia, No. 19-123, 141 S. Ct. 230 (Oct. 5, 2020); Kelly v. United States, No. \n18-1059, 140 S. Ct. 661 (Dec. 16, 2019); Rucho v. Common Cause, No. 18-422, 139 S. \nCt. 1316 (Mar. 15, 2019); McDonald v. City of Chicago, No. 08-1521, 130 S. Ct. 1317  \n(Jan. 25, 2010).     \n6. \nEagle County\u2019s brief emphasizes the aspect of this case in which Eagle \nCounty has a strong and local interest:  the Board\u2019s arbitrary discussion of \n\u201cdownline\u201d environmental effects stemming from the substantial increase in train \ntraffic on an existing rail line in Colorado, which passes through Eagle County.  The \nEnvironmental Respondents emphasize the Board\u2019s failure to consider \nenvironmental effects stemming from increased production of crude oil in the Basin \nand from refining that crude.  The distinction between these different sets of \nenvironmental effects is important because the Board and the court of appeals took \ndifferent approaches to these issues below.  The Board did not consider certain \nenvironmental effects of the increased production of Basin crude and refining of \nBasin crude, and the court of appeals held that its explanation for not doing so was \ninsufficient.  The Board did evaluate downline effects in Colorado, though its \nanalysis failed to comply with NEPA.  Eagle County\u2019s brief also explains why the \ndownline effects are not properly part of the case before this Court given the way \npetitioners chose to present the case at the certiorari stage. \n7. \nThis Court has also routinely allowed divided argument when, as here, \na government entity and a private party are on the same side of a dispute.  That \npractice recognizes that governmental parties have distinct interests that would be \n\n \n5 \nmore difficult for a private organization to represent.  See, e.g., Am. Legion v. Am. \nHumanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717, 139 S. Ct. 951 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2019) (dividing \nargument between the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission \nand private petitioners); see also Dep\u2019t of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966, 139 S. \nCt. 1543 (Apr. 12, 2019) (state and private petitioners); Tennessee Wine & Spirits \nAss\u2019n v. Blair, No. 18-96, 139 S. Ct. 783 (Jan. 4, 2019) (state and private petitioner); \nMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, No. 16-111, 138 S. Ct. 466 \n(Nov. 21, 2017) (state agency and private respondents).  As a local government, \nEagle County has a unique perspective on the importance of NEPA for states and \nlocalities.     \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, Eagle County and the Environmental Respondents \nrespectfully request that the Court permit divided argument. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKirti Datla \n     Counsel of Record \nBenjamin Chagnon \nEARTHJUSTICE \n1001 G Street, NW, Suite 1000 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nkdatla@earthjustice.org  \n(202) 797-5241 \n \nCounsel for Environmental  \nRespondents \n \nWilliam M.

The Solicitor General requests the following division \nof argument time:  15 minutes for petitioners, 15 minutes for the \nfederal \nrespondents \nsupporting \npetitioners. \n \nCounsel \nfor \npetitioners has agreed to that allocation. \nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. \nNo. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), \u201cdeclare[d] a \nnational policy,\u201d intended to \u201cencourage productive and enjoyable \nharmony between man and his environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4321.  NEPA\u2019s \n\n2 \n \ncore procedural mandate requires federal agencies to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement in connection with a proposal for \n\u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).   \nPetitioners Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and Uinta \nBasin Railway, LLC filed an application with the Surface \nTransportation Board (Board) to authorize the construction of a \nrailway line connecting the Uinta Basin with the national rail \nnetwork in Utah.  Pet. App. 6a.  The Board prepared an \nenvironmental impact statement analyzing a range of potential \nenvironmental consequences of the project before ultimately \ndeciding to authorize the railway line.  Id. at 6a-13a.  The non-\nfederal respondents filed petitions for review in the court of \nappeals \nchallenging \nthe \nBoard\u2019s \nNEPA \nanalysis \nunder \nthe \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 706(a)(2).  Id. at \n13a.  Petitioners intervened in support of the Board.  See id. at \n6a.   \nThe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \npartially \nvacated \nthe \nBoard\u2019s \nenvironmental impact statement.  Pet. App. 70a.  The court held \nthat the Board had adopted an unduly limited view of the scope of \nenvironmental impacts the Board was required to analyze, \nconcluding that the statement should have included additional \nanalysis of the upstream environmental effects of increased oil \nproduction in the Uinta Basin following completion of the new \nrailway line and the localized downstream effects of ultimately \n\n3 \n \nprocessing some of that oil in refineries in Texas and Louisiana.  \nPet. App. 28a-37a.  The court also found several flaws in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the downline effects of possible rail accidents \nand wildfires, as well as in its analysis of the potential harms \nto downline water resources.  See Pet. App. 40a-47a.   \nPetitioner then sought review in this Court, which granted \ncertiorari.  The federal respondents have filed an opening brief \non the merits supporting petitioners.   \nDividing \nthe \nargument \ntime \nfor \npetitioners \nbetween \npetitioners and the federal respondents supporting petitioners \nwould be of material assistance to this Court.  The federal \ngovernment has a substantial interest in this case because it \ninvolves a challenge to an environmental impact statement prepared \nby the Board, which is a federal agency, and because the question \npresented concerns the proper interpretation and application of a \nfederal environmental statute that applies to \u201call agencies of the \nFederal Government.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332.  Petitioners of course have \na substantial interest in this case because the partial vacatur of \nthe Board\u2019s environmental impact statement is an impediment to the \nconstruction of the new railway line that the Board authorized.   \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

AFRC \nrepresents more than 50 forest product businesses \nand \nforest \nlandowners \nthroughout \nOregon, \nWashington, California, Nevada, Idaho and Montana.  \nIt promotes active management to attain productive \npublic forests, protect the value and integrity of \nadjoining private forests, and support the economic \nand social foundations of local communities.  And it \nworks to improve federal and state laws, regulations, \npolicies and decisions regarding access to and \nmanagement of public forest lands and protection of \nall forest lands. \nThis case crystallizes an issue that has \nfrustrated AFRC and its members for years.  AFRC \nand its members understand that in the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), Congress required \nfederal regulators to pause and think critically about \nwhat effects the regulators\u2019 decisions would have on \n \n1 Per Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the undersigned affirms that no \ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \nsuch counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of the brief.  And as required \nby Rule 37.2, amicus\u2019s counsel notified counsel of record for all \nparties of amicus\u2019s intention to file this brief at least 10 days \nprior to the due date for the brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nthe \u201chuman environment,\u201d specifically \u201cto create and \nmaintain conditions under which man and nature can \nexist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, \neconomic, and other requirements of present and \nfuture generations of Americans.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a) \n(emphasis added); see also id. \u00a7 4332(C) (clarifying \nthat the focus is not on the \u201cenvironment\u201d for the \nenvironment\u2019s own sake, but on the \u201chuman \nenvironment\u201d).   \nCongress has required federal regulators \u201cto \ntake environmental consequences into account in \ntheir decisionmaking . . . eliminating the excuse . . . \noffered by bureaucrats that their statutory authority \ndid not authorize consideration of such factors in their \npolicy decisions.\u201d  Scenic Hudson Pres. Conf. v. Fed. \nPower Comm\u2019n, 407 U.S. 926, 927 (1972) (Douglas, J., \ndissenting from denial of certiorari).     \nAFRC and its members know, just as the \nSurface Transportation Board clearly knows, that the \nBoard and other federal regulators must take \nenvironmental consequences into account when \nmaking decisions.  They also know that Congress \nrequired proof that the federal regulators paused to \nconsider \nand \nexplain \nwhat \nenvironmental \nconsequences they had considered, and how they had \ndone so.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C).   \nBut that is all Congress demanded.  Yet as the \nlone dissenter at the Board and the lower court here \nhave \nshown, \nmany \njudges \nreviewing \nfederal \nregulators\u2019 \nactions \nhave \nevidently \nconsidered \nCongress\u2019s requirement as a point of departure\u2014\n\n3 \n \n \n \npreferring instead to read their own environmental-\npolicy preferences into their duties to assess whether \nfederal regulators considered and explained the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions. \nTake what has happened here:  Congress has \ncreated a presumption that constructing rail lines is \nin the public interest; the Surface Transportation \nBoard received an application to construct a rail line \nthat would be in the public interest\u2014including the \ninterest of communities that have been and would \notherwise continue to be left behind by successive \nPresidential Administrations; and then the Board \nspent years and many pages examining and \nexplaining the potential environmental consequences \nof constructing and operating the rail line.  In this \ncase, the federal regulators did what Congress \nrequired. \nBut for decades, the lower federal courts have \nlet \u201canti-use\u201d groups who disregard Congress\u2019s role in \nexpressing the public interest\u2014like the plaintiffs who \nsued here\u2014use NEPA as a weapon to prevent any \nfederal approvals of projects that would \u201ccreate and \nmaintain conditions under which man and nature can \nexist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, \neconomic, and other requirements of present and \nfuture generations of Americans.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4331(a).  Rather than be satisfied that the federal \nregulators have done their jobs and the public interest \ncan be realized, these groups and the federal courts \nthat enable them now \u201cflyspeck\u201d environmental \nexplanations, inventing supposed errors so they can \npromote their preferred outcomes.   \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCongress does not allow the anti-use groups \nand lower courts to do that\u2014the courts\u2019 task is not to \n\u201cflyspeck an agency\u2019s environmental analysis, looking \nfor any deficiency no matter how minor.\u201d  Nevada v. \nDep\u2019t of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  The \ncourts can only \u201capply a rule of reason standard \n(essentially an abuse of discretion standard) in \ndeciding \nwhether \nclaimed \ndeficiencies \nin \n[an \nenvironmental-consequences explanation] are merely \nflyspecks, or are significant enough to defeat the goals \nof informed decisionmaking and informed public \ncomment.\u201d  Utahns for Better Transp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nTransp., 305 F.3d 1152, 1163 (10th Cir. 2002).  An \nagency like the Board must be reasonable in \nconsidering \nand \nexplaining \nthe \nenvironmental \nconsequences of approving construction of a rail line \nthat is in the public interest; the federal regulators do \nnot have to be perfect.  FCC v. Prometheus Radio \nProject, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021); Marsh v. Oregon \nNat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 377 (1989). \nThe way the lower courts and other unelected \npersons have weaponized NEPA as an \u201canti-use\u201d \nauthority ignores\u2014or rejects\u2014the public interest.  \nAnd that practice is detrimental to AFRC and its \nmembers.  As an analogy to the rail line at issue here, \nCongress has declared in multiple statutes, such as \nthe Federal Land Policy and Management Act, that \nactive \nforest \nmanagement, \nincluding \ntimber \nharvesting, is in the public interest.  Yet when federal \nregulators approve timber-harvesting and related \nprojects and examine and explain the environmental \nconsequences of those approvals, the anti-use groups \nand many lower courts have weaponized NEPA to \n\n5 \n \n \n \nflyspeck the regulators\u2019 explanations and promote \ntheir own substantive results, which are often to \ncancel or at least greatly delay projects.  That is what \nthe plaintiffs, the lone dissenter at the Board, and the \nlower court did here.  But it must stop. \nAFRC is determined to stop this practice.  \nAFRC has publicly commented that the NEPA process \nhas \u201cunnecessarily slowed forest management and \nfire prevention projects on public lands [because] the \nlengthy timeframes required to complete an EIS and \nissue a Record of Decision [now] average . . . 4.5 years, \nand one quarter of EISs took more than 6 years.\u201d  See \nAFRC CEQ Comment 4.2  The ever-growing urgency \nto address forest health shows how the misguided\u2014\nand unlawful\u2014weaponization of NEPA continues to \nharm groups across many industries and the Country \nby preventing the realization of the public interest.   \nWhich begs the question in the light as AFRC \nsees it:  how will the public\u2019s interest in active forest \nmanagement be realized in the face of the \u201cthousands \nof NEPA lawsuits, many of which delay or kill federal \nprojects\u201d like the rail line in this case?

It evaluated the potential environmental \nconsequences potentially related to authorizing \nconstruction and operation of a rail line.  It explained \nall those issues in a detailed statement.  Yet the lower \ncourt ignored Congress and imposed its own priorities \nas superior to the public interest.   \n\n7 \n \n \n \nThis madness of requiring more\u2014weaponizing \nNEPA\u2014to prevent any uses of public lands must end.  \nAnd AFRC respectfully submits this brief asking the \nCourt to step in, review this case, and correct the \nundemocratic, unlawful path that many federal \nregulators and lower courts have taken. \n\u2666 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen it comes to building rail lines, Congress \nhas been clear about the public interest:  there is a \nrebuttable presumption that building a rail line is in \nthe public interest as long as the federal agency \nreviewing the proposal to build the line\u2014the Surface \nTransportation Board\u2014takes a \u201chard look\u201d at the \npotential environmental consequences of building it.  \nThat\u2019s what the Board did here. \nIn contrast, the court below and the lone \ndissenter at the Board would reverse the order, \nsupposedly because their shared idea of \u201cwhat is in \nthe public interest\u201d is superior to Congress\u2019s clear \nstatement of that interest.  The lone dissenter went \nfurther, asserting that he alone knows that \n\u201cDecarbonization is national policy\u201d and that is \nthe public interest, Pet.App.146a (emphasis in \noriginal)\u2014never mind what Congress says.   \nThere is a troubling trend in which the lower \ncourts are using NEPA to put their interests or other \nanti-use groups\u2019 interests over the public interest.  \nBut at least with respect to building rail lines, two \n\n8 \n \n \n \ncircuit courts have been clear that building them is \npresumptively in the public interest.  The fact that the \nlower court here got the public\u2019s interest backward, in \nconflict with other circuit courts, is sufficient reason \nfor this Court to review the lower court\u2019s decision.  See \nRule 10(a).   \nTo make the matter worse, the lower court \ndisregarded this Court\u2019s explanation in Department of \nTransportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), \nof how an agency takes a \u201chard look\u201d at the potential \nenvironmental consequences of an action when the \nagency cannot directly regulate those environmental \nconsequences, further justifying the Court\u2019s review of \nthe lower court\u2019s decision.  See Rule 10(c). \nThe lower court prevented construction of a \nmuch-needed rail line based on an overreaching \nconclusion that the Surface Transportation Board did \nnot \nperform \nan \nadequate \nanalysis \nof \nthe \nenvironmental consequences that building and \noperating the rail line might, potentially, maybe could \nhave, and even though the Board could do nothing to \nregulate those consequences.  But the lower court \nwent so far down the path of looking for things to \ncriticize that it lost the forest for the trees.   \nThe lower court\u2019s confusion (or, less charitably, \nits desire to prevent the rail line) misses the point:  the \nBoard followed NEPA because it made the detailed \nstatement that Congress required it to make about \nenvironmental consequences.  The Board acted \nreasonably and otherwise lawfully.  The lower court\u2019s \n\n9 \n \n \n \ncontrary approach to NEPA hurts not only those \nrelying on the rail line but also AFRC and its members \nwho are trying to realize the public\u2019s interest in active \nforest management. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nCongress has decided that building rail \nlines is in the public interest. \nCongress has spoken clearly:  the presumption \nis that building rail lines is in the public interest, and \nthe Surface Transportation Board should approve \nsuch construction accordingly.  As Congress said it, \n\u201cThe Board shall issue a certificate authorizing \nactivities for which such authority is requested in an \napplication . . . unless the Board finds that such \nactivities are inconsistent with the public convenience \nand necessity.  Such certificate may approve the \napplication as filed, or with modifications, and may \nrequire compliance with conditions . . . the Board finds \nnecessary in the public interest.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(c) \n(emphasis added). \nAt least two circuit courts agree that \u201cthere is a \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved.\u201d  Mid States Coal. for Progress v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) \n(emphasis added); N. Plains Res. Council v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 668 F.3d 1067, 1092 (9th Cir. 2011); see \nalso Lebron v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. \n374, 383\u201384 (1995) (\u201cCongress established Amtrak in \norder to avert the threatened extinction of passenger \ntrains in the United States.  The statute that created \n\n10 \n \n \n \nit begins with the congressional finding, redolent of \nprovisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, see, e.g., \n49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10901, 10903, 10922 . . . that \u2018the public \nconvenience and necessity require the continuance \nand improvement\u2019 of railroad passenger service.\u201d). \nThis congressional preference is important to \nAFRC because Congress has also spoken clearly that \nactive forest management, which includes timber \nharvesting and is vital to AFRC\u2019s members, is in the \npublic interest.  For example, we know from Congress \nthat it is in the public interest that federal agencies \nmanage \u201cpublic lands\u201d \u201cin a manner which recognizes \nthe Nation\u2019s need for domestic sources of . . . timber . \n. . from the public lands.\u201d  43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a)(12) \n(emphasis added).  And Congress emphasized that \nfederal agencies must explain themselves to Congress \nwhen they try to eliminate \u201ctimber production\u201d from \nfederal lands.  43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1702(l) (\u201ctimber \nproduction\u201d is a \u201cprincipal or major use\u201d of federal \nlands), 1712(e)(1)\u2013(2) (heightened scrutiny given to \nfederal management decisions that eliminate a \n\u201cprincipal or major use\u201d of federal lands). \nAlong similar lines, Congress has required \ndetailed planning for and protection of timber \nharvesting \u201c[i]n recognition of the vital importance \nof America\u2019s renewable resources of the forest . . . to \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nsocial \nand \neconomic \nwell-being.\u201d  \n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a) (emphasis added).3  So AFRC is \n \n3 And when Congress created a multiple-use policy for the \nnational forests, it included timber harvesting as an important \nuse, rather than exclude timber harvesting in favor of anti-use \n(or, pristine preservation) purposes.  16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 528, 531. \n\n11 \n \n \n \nvery troubled by the approach that the Surface \nTransportation Board\u2019s lone dissenter and the lower \ncourt took in this case.  At best, they disregarded the \npublic interest in favor of their own goals.  Worse, they \nused NEPA as a weapon against the public interest.  \nBut that is not what Congress intended in NEPA. \nII. \nCongress conditioned the public interest \non a requirement to take a \u201chard look\u201d at \npotential environmental consequences. \nIn NEPA, Congress did not contemplate that a \nfederal court or an unelected bureaucrat would be able \nto cancel (either directly or by indefinite delay) federal \napprovals of the projects that serve the public \ninterest.  Instead, when a federal agency decides that \nits proposed action\u2014here, approving construction of a \nrail line\u2014will \u201csignificantly affect[] the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d then it must describe in detail \nthe \u201cenvironmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \n\u201cany adverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided should the proposal be implemented.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C)(i)\u2013(ii).   \nThe role for the court is to ensure that the \nagency has taken a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental \nconsequences.  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, \n410 n.21 (1976).  A court cannot interject itself within \nthe agency\u2019s discretion as to the choice of the action.  \nId.  At most, Congress put the courts in the position of \ndeciding whether agency actions are \u201creasonable and \nreasonably explained.\u201d  Prometheus Radio Project, 592 \nU.S. at 423. \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThat is where the lower court went wrong here.  \nIt took the question of \u201cwhat is reasonable,\u201d and it \nused that question as a point of departure.  To its \ncredit, the lower court did mention the point that \nwhen an agency\u2014here, the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2014is trying to look at and explain environmental \nconsequences of a proposed action, then \u201creasonable\u201d \nis \u201cthe operative word.\u201d  Pet.App.32a.  But then the \nlower court got off-track. \nThe concept of what is \u201creasonable\u201d is one that \ncomes up often and which this Court has addressed in \nmany contexts, including in cases arising (ultimately, \nas this one does) under the Administrative Procedure \nAct.4  E.g., Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 427\u2013\n28 (\u201cIn light of the sparse record on minority and \nfemale ownership and the FCC\u2019s findings with respect \nto competition, localism, and viewpoint diversity, we \ncannot say that the agency\u2019s decision to repeal or \nmodify the ownership rules fell outside the zone of \nreasonableness for purposes of the APA.\u201d).  But the \nlower courts are not listening to this Court.  On the \nsurface, they acknowledge that \u201creasonable\u201d is the \nrequirement, but then they go way further so that \nthey can prevent projects that they do not like. \nUsing this case as an example, the lower court \nacknowledged \u201creasonable\u201d as its lodestar, see \nPet.App.32a, but then the court went off the rails.   \n \n4 Prometheus Radio Project might be especially on point for its \nrole in working through a case about what is reasonable for an \nagency to do when Congress has explained what is in the public \ninterest.  See id. \n\n13 \n \n \n \na. \nThe lower court misapplied Public \nCitizen\u2019s \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d \nanalysis. \nThere are many ways the lower court could \nhave found some outer limit of what would have been \n\u201creasonable\u201d for the Surface Transportation Board to \ndo in this case.  Petitioners have focused on one, \nPet. 14, and that one is sufficient for the Court\u2019s \nreview of this case.   \nIn Department of Transportation v. Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004), the Court rejected \n\u201ca particularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a \ncause of an environmental effect even when the \nagency has no authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  As \nparticularly relevant to this case, the Court examined \nwhether NEPA required a federal agency to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of cross-border operations of \nMexican-domiciled motor carriers, where the agency\u2019s \npromulgation of certain regulations would allow such \ncross-border operations to occur.  Id. at 756.   \nThe answer was \u201cno,\u201d NEPA did not require the \nagency to evaluate those effects because they were out \nof the agency\u2019s control, even though the agency\u2019s \naction \u201cwould allow\u201d the activities that could result \nin environmental consequences.  Id. at 756, 767\u201368 \n(emphasis added).  Why?  Because lacking the ability \nto directly regulate the activities\u2014less speculative \nthere \nthan \nin \nthis \ncase\u2014that \nwould \nhave \nenvironmental consequences, the agency properly \nrealized that those consequences simply were not \n\n14 \n \n \n \nrelevant to its decision whether to act.  The agency \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on whatever \ninformation\u201d it allegedly should have considered and \nexplained to the public.  Id. at 768.5 \nThe same principle applies here:  lacking the \nability to directly regulate any future \u201cupstream\u201d oil \nand gas production from federal, private, or state \nminerals in the Uinta Basin and lacking the ability to \ndirectly regulate any future \u201cdownstream\u201d processing \nof oil and gas at refineries (whether in any of various \nregions of the Country or, potentially, somewhere else \nin the world), the Surface Transportation Board \nproperly realized that those entirely speculative \nenvironmental consequences were not relevant to its \ndecision whether to approve construction of the rail \nline\u2014even, as was true in Public Citizen, if the \n \n5 Contra Mid States Coal. for Progress, 345 F.3d at 548\u201351 (8th \nCir. 2003)\u2014while AFRC agrees with the circuit court\u2019s \nexplanation in Mid States Coal. for Progress that rail \nconstruction presumptively is in the public interest, supra p. 9, \nAFRC disagrees with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Surface \nTransportation Board erred in that case by refusing to speculate \nwhether construction of the rail line might, potentially, maybe \nlead to increased demand for coal (or supply of coal) and even \nmore speculative increases in air pollutants.   \nAs the circuit court acknowledged, \u201cthe Board did a highly \ncommendable and professional job in evaluating an enormously \ncomplex proposal.\u201d  Id. at 556.  Yet the court disregarded the \npublic interest, instead demanding that the Board document its \nguesses about non-existent environmental consequences.  The \ncircuit court there also got the analysis wrong.  A similar thing \nhappened in N. Plains Res. Council, Inc., 668 F.3d at 1077\u201379. \nThe circuit courts are completely backward on NEPA when \nCongress has spoken about the public interest, emphasizing the \npoint that the Court here should accept this case. \n\n15 \n \n \n \nBoard\u2019s approval would allow such future oil and gas \nproduction and such future refining to occur.  See \nPet.App.107a\u2013109a, 112a; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n767\u201368.  The Board\u2019s decision was fully consistent \nwith Public Citizen. \nThe lower court brushed off the Court\u2019s Public \nCitizen analysis, Pet.App.36a; but the lower court\u2019s \nexplanation shows that the court got lost in the woods.  \nThe lower court could not get past the point that the \nBoard\u2019s approval might, potentially, maybe could \nresult in future \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d air \npollution.  Pet.App.33a\u201337a.  The lower court suggests \nthat distinguishes this case from Public Citizen, see \nPet.App.36a, but not so.   \nThe agency action in Public Citizen was much \nmore \u201cproximate\u201d to the threatened environmental \nconsequences than the complete guesswork that the \nBoard faced in this case.  And Public Citizen \nestablished the point that the Board did not have to \nengage in or explain such attenuated guesswork about \nwhat might happen \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d as \na \u201cbut for\u201d cause of allowing construction and \noperation of a rail line in the Uinta Basin.  See Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767\u201368.   \nThe lower court either misunderstood or \notherwise misapplied Public Citizen, Pet.App.36a, \nand either way the lower court\u2019s decision conflicts \nwith this Court\u2019s relevant decision.  Under Rule 10(c), \nthat is among \u201cthe character of the reasons\u201d making \nthe lower court\u2019s decision suitable for review.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nb. \nPublic \nCitizen \nreinforces \nthat \nfederal regulators and courts should \nnot put their interests above the \npublic interest. \nThe lower court\u2019s application of Public Citizen \ndeserves deeper treatment specifically addressing \nhow the lower courts have used (or, misused) NEPA \nto defy the public interest.   \nTo start with a basic premise: \u201cNEPA itself does \nnot mandate particular results in order to accomplish \n[its] ends.  Rather, NEPA imposes only procedural \nrequirements on federal agencies with a particular \nfocus on requiring agencies to undertake analyses of \nthe environmental impact of their proposals and \nactions.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 756\u201357 (quoting \nRobertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. \n332, 350 (1989)).   \nThe thrust of Public Citizen was that we should \nexpect agencies to be reasonable in considering the \nenvironmental consequences of the actions they took \nto serve the public interest, but nothing more than \nthat.  See 541 U.S. at 764\u201370.  Agencies must be \nreasonable \nabout \nconsidering \nand \nexplaining \nenvironmental consequences of their actions where \nthere is \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship \nbetween the environmental effect and the alleged \ncause.\u201d  Id. at 767.  And as in common law, there are \ncircumstances that cut off what is \u201creasonable\u201d in \ncontext, such as whether the agency could directly \nregulate the actions that would have known \nenvironmental consequences.  See id. at 768. \n\n17 \n \n \n \nHere, as the Board and Petitioners explained, \nthe Board\u2019s inability to do anything either way about \nfuture oil and gas drilling in the Uinta Basin or \nprocessing of Uinta Basin oil wherever that oil ended \nup was a sufficient reason for the Board to not go \nbeyond its detailed statement of the environmental \nconsequences of approving the construction of the rail \nline.  See Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 756\u201357.   \nBut to AFRC, this case means more than about \nwhether the Board could pick which refinery the oil \nwould go to\u2014the lower court\u2019s approach to NEPA is \nbackward, and that hurts AFRC and its members.  \nThe Board gave a detailed statement about all the \npotential environmental consequences; it discussed \nthem in detail, including a discussion about how and \nwhy it would have to at some point cut off its analysis.  \nSee, e.g., Pet.App.107a\u2013112a.  That is enough. \nAfter this explanation, the Board did not reach \nthe substantive conclusion (rejecting construction of \nthe rail line) that the plaintiffs, the lone dissenter at \nthe Board, or the lower court wanted.  Of course they \nwant more explanation!  They want to force the Board \nto explain and explain for years and years until they \nget an explanation against building the rail line.   \nBut that results-focused approach does not \nserve NEPA\u2019s \u201cinformational purpose.\u201d  See Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768\u201369.  The Board \u201cindeed \nconsidered \nenvironmental \nconcerns \nin \nits \ndecisionmaking process,\u201d see id., and that is all the \nBoard had to do.   \n\n18 \n \n \n \nThe importance of review in this case is that, \nlike Petitioners, AFRC and its members need the \nCourt to step forward and tell the lower courts and the \nfederal regulators that Congress did not codify \nNEPA to subvert the public interest.  But if the \nCourt decides not to review this case, then that is the \nmessage the Court will send to those who think their \npriorities are superior to the public interest. \nIII. \nThe Court can stop lower courts elevating \ntheir priorities over the public interest, \nand that would help AFRC\u2019s members. \nThe phenomenon shown by the lower court in \nthis case goes beyond questions of shipping fossil fuels \nin pipelines and on trains.  As AFRC and its members \nknow well, courts and federal regulators have often \nelevated their substantive anti-use priorities over the \npublic\u2019s interest in active forest management, \nincluding timber harvesting, resulting in devastated \ncommunities. \nTake, for example, the \u201cBlack Ram\u201d project, \nwhich is currently at a circuit court.6  There, the \nForest Service spent many years analyzing a project \nthat would involve vegetation management including \ncommercial timber harvest and other fire-mitigation \nmeasures.  The whole point of the project was to \npromote the public\u2019s interests in resilient vegetation, \nhealthy \nwatersheds, \nbig-game \nranges, \nforage \nopportunities, recreational opportunities, reducing \n \n6 See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv., 2023 WL \n5310633 (D. Mont. Aug. 17, 2023).  The Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has docketed the appeal as No. 23-2886. \n\n19 \n \n \n \nhigh-intensity \nwildfires, \nand \nsupplying \nforest \nproducts that contribute to the sustainable supply of \ntimber products.  These are things that Congress has \nsaid are in the public interest.  See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 528, 531. \nThe Forest Service began developing the \nproject in 2017 and spent five years analyzing the \nenvironmental consequences of the project before \napproving it.  The agency prepared a 435-page \nenvironmental assessment.  And among many topics, \nthe \nForest \nService \nconsidered \nand \nexplained \nenvironmental consequences on grizzly bears, and \nultimately approved a version of the project.   \nIn particular, the Forest Service went to great \nlengths to calculate and otherwise estimate the \n\u201cbaseline\u201d number of bears that lived in the 95,000-\nacre project-area so that it could explain the potential \nenvironmental consequences of the project on those \nbears.  The Forest Service went way beyond what was \nreasonable to figure out the potential environmental \nconsequences on bears, and it explained its process \nand conclusions at length.  But never mind the \npublic\u2019s interest in realizing all of the public-interest \npurposes that the Black Ram project would promote; \na few persons and a federal court did not like the \npotential substantive result of the project on grizzly \nbears, and they used NEPA as weapon to defeat the \npublic in favor of their own interests.  See Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity, 2023 WL 5310633, at *3\u20137. \nWhy did these few know better about the public \ninterest than the public knew?  Well, as they tell it, \n\n20 \n \n \n \nbecause all those purposes that would serve the public \ninterest could not measure up to a difference of \nopinion between the Forest Service and the plaintiffs \nas to exactly how to estimate the \u201cbaseline\u201d population \nof grizzly bears in the 95,000-acre area.  It did not \nmatter what was reasonable; it did not matter \nwhether the few were \u201cflyspecking\u201d; it did not matter \nwhether the Forest Service gave a \u201chard look\u201d to \nenvironmental consequences.  The district court \ndecided that answering the question whether there \nwere 60 bears in the area\u2014or a few more bears or a \nfew fewer bears\u2014served NEPA without regard to the \npublic interest.   \nPut another way, the district court decided that \nits desire to know how many grizzly bears lived in the \nproject area was more important than all the public \npurposes that the project would serve.  And it did so \ndespite the many pages and years\u2014recited at length \nby the district court\u2014devoted to examining and \nexplaining the environmental consequences of the \nproposed project.  In the context of the Black Ram \nproject, Public Citizen is important for the limit to \n\u201cbut-for causation\u201d on what is reasonable, but it is \neven more important for explaining that such myopic, \nself-serving motivations that harm the public interest \nare both unlawful (by the regulators) and wrong (by \nthe lower courts).   \nAnd the district court went further, turning its \nsight on the types of environmental consequences the \nSurface Transportation Board\u2019s lone dissenter focused \non in the case at this Court.  See id. at *8\u201311.  With \nrespect to \u201cclimate impacts,\u201d the district court went \n\n21 \n \n \n \nway beyond what Congress and even regulators \nrequire.  Id. at *8 (\u201cAlthough NEPA\u2019s implementing \nregulations somewhat cabin broader environmental \nanalyses[.]\u201d) (emphasis added).  The main \u201cclimate\u201d \nissue was whether potential forest management\u2014\nincluding timber harvesting\u2014would have meaningful \n\u201cclimate impacts\u201d because the act of harvesting a tree \n(of course, without consideration of the benefits of \nactive forest management) might result in one less \nway to remove carbon from ambient air.  Id. at *9\u201310.   \nThe district court then went through analyses, \nincluding qualitative and quantitative analyses, and \nconcluded, \u201cFederal Defendants and the Tribe counter \nthat the USFS properly analyzed environmental \nimpacts \nin \na \nmanner \nproportionate \nto \ntheir \nsignificance, \nwhich \nthey \ninsist \nare \nlocalized, \ninfinitesimal, and minor.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs are \ncorrect because although the USFS took steps to \nexplain how the Project could impact carbon \nemissions, it did so only in general terms, which does \nnot meet NEPA\u2019s \u2018hard look\u2019 standard.\u201d  Id. at *10.   \nThe district court had quantitative analyses in \nfront of it.  For example:  \u201cThe Project Carbon Report \nnotes that the Project would decrease these potential \nthreats by increasing the long-term productivity of the \nforest, leading to higher future carbon sequestration.  \nFS-020743.  And it further notes that: \u2018The total \ncarbon stored on the Kootenai National Forest is \napproximately 174 Tg, or about thirty-nine one \nhundredths of one percent (0.0039) of approximately \n44,931 Tg of carbon stored in forests of the \ncoterminous United States.\u2019 FS-020743.  Although it \n\n22 \n \n \n \ndoes not provide hard numbers explaining how much \ncarbon would be released if the Project were \nimplemented . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).  Id. at *9.  In \nthe court\u2019s logic, if you do not like the result of a \nfederal action, then you can keep demanding more \nand more explanation taking years and years until \nyou get the substantive result you want.  The district \ncourt was determined to find a NEPA violation despite \nthe public interest, no matter how \u201clocalized, \ninfinitesimal, [or] minor,\u201d see id. at *10, the alleged \nlack-of-explanation was.  \nHere, by agreeing to review the lower court\u2019s \ndecision and erroneous elevation of NEPA above the \npublic interest, the Court would be able to send a \nmessage to lower courts that, for example, they should \nnot set aside a Forest Service project that would \nsupport many purposes that are in the public interest \njust because a few people want more clarity on exactly \nhow many grizzly bears live in a 95,000-acre area.  \nThose people and that judge do not get to decide what \nis in the public interest. \nFor AFRC and its members, there are many \nexamples of lower courts wielding NEPA as a weapon \nto defeat the public interest, including the public \ninterest in active forest management.  In this case, the \nlower court recognized that elevating its desired \nsubstantive anti-use outcomes over the public interest \nwould harm the people of the Uinta Basin, a roughly \n12,000-square-mile area in the West that is generally \ncut off from the rest of the world.  See Pet.App.7a; Pet. \n9.  The Tribe members and others who rely on the \nBasin, including their elected representatives, spoke \n\n23 \n \n \n \nout to the Surface Transportation Board, urging \napproval of this helpful project.  See, e.g., Pet.App.78a \nn.2; Pet.App.194a.  Congress was not alone in \nprofessing that construction of the rail line was in the \npublic interest, the public said so too.  Id.   \nThe lower court and the lone dissenter at the \nBoard decided they knew better about the public \ninterest than the public did.  But as Judge Tallman of \nthe Ninth Circuit recently warned, \u201cthe unfortunate \nback-end cost\u201d of that approach \u201cis that small, local \ncommunities reliant on the cultivation of natural \nresources to generate revenue to sustain them are \noften left behind.\u201d  Murphy Co. v. Biden, 65 F.4th \n1122, 1143 (9th Cir. 2023) (Tallman, J., dissenting in \npart), cert. denied, 2024 WL 1241467 (U.S. Mar. 25, \n2024) (\u201cJustice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh \nwould grant the petitions for writs of certiorari.\u201d). \nUnfortunately, the lower court\u2014like the lone \ndissenter at the Board\u2014decided that it knew better \nabout the public interest than did Congress and the \npublic itself.  Congress did not intend for NEPA to be \n\u201cweaponized\u201d in this way, creating a platform for \n\u201canti-use\u201d initiatives to succeed despite the public \ninterest.   \nAccordingly, for the sake of Petitioners in this \ncase, the people who live in or rely on the Uinta Basin, \nand AFRC and its members, AFRC respectfully asks \nthe Court to review this case and ultimately rule in \nthe Petitioners\u2019 favor. \n\n24 \n \n \n \n\u2666 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, AFRC respectfully \nasks this Court to grant the petition for writ of \ncertiorari. \nRespectfully submitted, \nIvan L.

It is the single most important document to read at this stage to understand the petitioner's side of the argument.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because it reinforces a core, effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: prioritize the primary source briefs from the parties. While not a novel or experimental strategy, confirming the high information yield of this fundamental step is crucial for solidifying a robust and reliable prediction methodology. It validates the 'read the party briefs first' heuristic as a cornerstone of the agent's design.\n\nJoint EIG is the sum of these two, reflecting that this is an extremely valuable action for both the specific task and the general strategy.",

But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.  Seeking to benefit ranchers, \n\n10 \nfarmers, tribal citizens, and others, the Coalition \nfocused its efforts on rail\u2014a cheaper, safer, and \ncleaner alternative to trucking.  In partnership with \nUinta Basin Railway, LLC, the Coalition sought \napproval from STB to build a new 88-mile rail line \nrunning southwest from the basin to central Utah that \nwould carry diverse commodities to and from the heart \nof \nthe \nbasin \nvia \nthe \nnational \nrail \nnetwork.  \nPet.App.192a. \nThe successor to the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, \nSTB \n\u201cis \nan \nindependent \nfederal \nagency \u2026 charged with the economic regulation of \nvarious modes of surface transportation, primarily \nfreight rail,\u201d but extending to \u201ccertain passenger rail \nmatters, the intercity bus industry, non-energy \npipelines, \nhousehold \ngoods \ncarriers\u2019 \ntariffs, \nand \u2026 non-contiguous domestic water transportation\u201d \nbetween \u201cthe mainland United States, Hawaii, \nAlaska,\u201d and the territories.  Surface Transp. Bd., \nAbout STB, https://bit.ly/3AjwrUO (last visited Aug. \n28, 2024).  As relevant here, Congress made STB \nresponsible for authorizing construction of new \nrailroad lines.  See generally 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901.  \nResponsibility for safety, as distinct from economic, \nregulation of the rails lies elsewhere, in the Federal \nRailroad \nAdministration, \nhoused \nwithin \nthe \nTransportation Department.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin., About FRA, \nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/about-fra \n(last \nvisited Aug. 28, 2024).  Reflecting STB\u2019s relatively \nlimited remit, Congress requires members of the \nBoard to have experience in transportation, economic \nregulation, or business.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a71301(b)(2).   \n\n11 \n2. To help secure financing for the new rail line, \nthe Coalition asked STB to conditionally approve the \nUinta Basin Railway project pending full NEPA \nreview.  Pet.App.204a.  Multiple environmental \ngroups objected, including the Center for Biological \nDiversity, which argued, among other things, that the \nnew rail line would not be financially viable because \n(it said) the basin did not need additional crude-oil \ntransportation \ncapacity. \n \nPet.App.197a. \n \nSTB \nultimately granted conditional approval, but made \nclear that \u201c[c]onstruction may not begin unless and \nuntil the Board issues a final decision\u201d \u201caddressing \nany potential environmental impacts.\u201d  Pet.App.209a.  \nSTB began its NEPA review of the proposed \nrailway in 2019.  Roughly a year and a half later, it \nissued a draft EIS describing the environmental \neffects of three alternative rail alignments and a no-\nbuild alternative.  Pet.App.79a.  STB took the next ten \nmonths to finalize the EIS, reviewing thousands of \ncomments from the public and requesting a report \nfrom the Fish & Wildlife Service about the project\u2019s \nimpact on protected species of fish in the Upper \nColorado River basin.  Pet.App.10a-11a, 50a-51a.  The \nresulting final EIS spanned 3,600 pages and analyzed \nhow \u201cconstruction and operation of the Railway\u201d \nwould impact \u201cwater resources, air quality, special \nstatus species like the greater sage-grouse, land use \nand recreation, local economies, cultural resources, \nand the Ute Indian tribe,\u201d among other things.  \nPet.App.11a; see JA94-105 (EIS table of contents).   \nThe EIS extensively discussed the possibility that \nthe railway might export waxy crude.  \u201cTo the extent \nthat the crude oil would be refined into fuels that \n\n12 \nwould be combusted to produce energy, emissions \nfrom the combustion of the fuels would produce,\u201d \nunder the maximum production scenario, \u201c0.8% of \nnationwide [greenhouse gas] emissions and 0.1% of \nglobal [greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d  Pet.App.106a.  \nThe EIS predicted that roughly half of the oil would be \ndelivered to the Texas Gulf Coast, and another third \nto the Louisiana Gulf Coast, though it could not \n\u201cidentify specific refineries.\u201d  Pet.App.34a, 111a.   \nCloser to the project itself, the EIS estimated the \nnumber of oil wells that would be added in the Basin \ndue to increased oil production enabled by the rail \nproject, while acknowledging that the location of such \n\u201cas yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects\u201d was uncertain.  Pet.App.31a.  The EIS also \nstudied the impact of additional rail traffic on the \nnational rail system, using modeling and historical \ndata to \u201cdetermine[] that the new Railway would lead \nto increased downline traffic, ranging from 0.4 to 9.5 \ntrains per day\u201d and, at most, \u201c0.89 additional \npredicted accidents per year.\u201d  Pet.App.40a.  STB \nultimately concluded that these \u201cminimal increases in \ntrain traffic on existing rail lines over which trains \nalready operate [were] unlikely to cause significant \nimpacts\u201d to vehicle safety and delay, rail safety, noise \nand vibration, air quality, or greenhouse gases.  \nPet.App.110a.   \nIn the end, the EIS concluded that one of the \nalternative rail alignments (the \u201cWhitmore Park \nAlternative\u201d) would \u201cresult in the fewest significant \nimpacts on the environment.\u201d  Pet.App.115a.  The EIS \nalso \nrecommended \nextensive \nenvironmental \n\n13 \nmitigation conditions.  Pet.App.76a; see Pet.App.149a-\n189a.   \nAfter considering the EIS, the Fish & Wildlife \nService\u2019s biological opinion, a separate geological \nstudy evaluating the risk of landslides and other \ngeologic movements, and more, STB issued a final \ndecision approving construction and operation of the \nWhitmore Park Alternative, subject to the mitigation \nrecommendations.  Pet.App.10a-11a.  STB\u2019s final \napproval of the 88-mile railway tracked Congress\u2019 \ndirective in the agency\u2019s organic statute\u2014which \ninstructs STB to approve rail-construction proposals \n\u201cunless [it] finds that such activities are inconsistent \nwith the public convenience and necessity,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n\u00a710901(c); see Mid-States Coal. for Progress v. STB, \n345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) (\u00a710901 creates \u201ca \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved\u201d)\u2014as STB found no basis to conclude from \nthe EIS that any adverse impacts of the new rail line \nwould outweigh the benefits to public convenience and \nnecessity, particularly in light of the extensive \nmitigation requirements the EIS imposed.   \n3. Various environmental groups led by the \nCenter for Biological Diversity sought review of STB\u2019s \ndecision in the D.C. Circuit.  They were joined by \nEagle County, Colorado, which lies hundreds of miles \ndistant from the Uinta Basin, and is significantly \ncloser geographically to Denver than the Utah border.  \nThe court of appeals consolidated the cases and \nallowed Seven County and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC, \nto intervene in defense of STB\u2019s decision.   \nAs relevant here, the Center faulted the EIS for \nnot \u201canalyz[ing] the potential for tens of thousands of \n\n14 \nadditional barrels of oil shipments daily and their \nprocessing in [Gulf Coast] locales to further worsen \npollution burdens.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  The Center likewise \nturned the potential for the railway to spur economic \ndevelopment in a \u201cvast area\u201d against the project, \nflyspecking the EIS for failing to analyze the potential \nfor \u201cwell and road construction, drilling, and truck \ntraffic [to] destroy and degrade habitat.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  \nAnd the Center knocked the EIS for not taking enough \nof \u201ca \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline,\u201d \u201cthe risk and impact of wildfires,\u201d or the \npotential impacts on \u201cthe Colorado River\u201d \u201cgiven the \nincreased rail traffic resulting from the Railway.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a, 46a. \nSTB\u2019s response was straightforward:  Under \nMetropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, it did not \nneed to consider those far-downstream (or down-track) \npotentialities, all of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited \nremit.  STB \u201ccannot regulate or mitigate\u201d any of the \nalleged potential \u201cimpacts\u201d the Center raised.  \nPet.App.31a.  Nor can it accurately predict them.  \n\u201c[A]ny \u2026 development in the Uinta Basin occurring as \na result of the [Railway] will be done in the future as \npart of as yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects that would occur on as yet unidentified \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(second alteration in original).  The amount of new \nconstruction is \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d given the \ninterplay between and among market forces, private \ndecisions, and regulatory actions outside STB\u2019s \ncontrol.  Pet.App.31a.  Likewise, although STB could \nidentify \u201cgeneral geographic regions\u201d where any oil \nmight go to be refined, \u201cthere [wa]s no way to predict \nor assess impacts to specific nearby communities from \n\n15 \nrefining that oil,\u201d because it was impossible to identify \nany one refinery.  Pet.App.31-32a.  And although STB \nestimated that marginal increases in rail traffic could \ncause 0.89 new accidents per year, accidents involving \na loaded crude train would occur far less frequently, \nand the evidence in the record suggested that \nmarginal wildfire risk \u201cwould not be significant.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a-43a, 46a.  \nNone of that was enough for the D.C. Circuit.  The \ndecision below concluded that STB\u2019s \u201cargument that it \nneed not consider effects it cannot prevent is simply \ninapplicable.\u201d  Pet.App.37a.  The court further held \nthat STB \u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could \nnot employ \u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the \naforementioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  \nPet.App.35a.  Invoking its decision in Sabal Trail, the \ncourt found that by taking the trouble to trace \nincreased waxy crude production in rural Utah to \nrefineries on the Gulf Coast, STB had bound itself to \ngo further to analyze the impact of refining activities \non Gulf Coast communities, including contributions to \nclimate \nchange. \n \nPet.App.33a-36a; \nsee \nalso \nPet.App.66a.  The court thus vacated the order and \nremanded for STB to redo the EIS.  Pet.App.70a-71a.1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA imposes a sensible procedural requirement \nthat federal agencies consider a proposed project\u2019s \nenvironmental impact before greenlighting it.  It is not \nsupposed to operate as a substantive obstacle to \n \n1 The D.C. Circuit also remanded for STB to address non-NEPA \nissues and for Fish & Wildlife to address an aspect of its biological \nopinion.  Those non-NEPA issues are not before this Court. \n\n16 \nprojects, requiring agencies to consider remote \npossibilities or empowering project opponents to win a \nwar of attrition by repeatedly forcing agencies to \nconsider just one more possibility.  This Court\u2019s \nprecedents ensure that NEPA strikes a reasonable \nbalance by limiting an agency\u2019s obligations to \nconsidering environmental effects with a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d to the agency\u2019s proposed \naction, and then reviewing the agency\u2019s analysis \nunder NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  The D.C. \nCircuit has lost sight of those limits, as this case \ndramatically illustrates.  STB studied all that NEPA \nrequires and then some in a 3,600-page EIS, but \nenvironmental \nobjectors \nand \nthe \nD.C. \nCircuit \ndemanded still more, including an exhaustive review \nof matters as remote as the impact of additional oil \nrefining (that the new railway theoretically could \nspur) on air quality on the Gulf Coast.  Invoking its \nSabal Trail decision, the D.C. Circuit effectively \npunished STB for going beyond what NEPA requires, \nholding that STB\u2019s efforts to trace increased crude \nproduction to Gulf Coast refineries obligated it to \nstudy environmental effects thousands of miles \nremoved from the project at issue.  There is simply no \nrole under NEPA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s precedents for \nstymying \ndevelopment \nprojects \nbased \non \nenvironmental effects that are so wildly remote in \ngeography and time.  This Court should reaffirm that \nNEPA embodies a demanding form of proximate \ncause, not mere but-for causation, and reverse. \nThis Court has been clear.  \u201cNEPA requires\u201d \nstudying an environmental effect only when there is \n\u201c\u2018a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u2019\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\n17 \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d\u2014\u201cbetween \nthe \nenvironmental \neffect and the alleged cause,\u201d and only when the \nagency \u201chas \u2026 statutory authority over\u201d the \u201ceffect,\u201d \nand thus the \u201cability to prevent\u201d it.  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767, 770 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at \n774).  While the D.C. Circuit cited this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, it required STB\u2019s NEPA analysis to \ntransgress the limits of proximate cause and STB\u2019s \npurview, while giving STB no leeway to make \nreasonable judgments about dim and distant effects. \nThat was legal error.  This Court\u2019s repeated \nemphasis on proximate cause and \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship[s]\u201d between a project and its \nenvironmental effects, Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nrules out the need to consider effects that are far \nremoved in geography and time or that are separated \nby multiple intervening causes that themselves are \nnon-environmental and highly uncertain.  It strains \ncredulity to contend that laying 88 miles of track in \nrural Utah is proximately related to climate change or \nenvironmental harm in Gulf Coast communities.  So \ntoo for potential downline train accidents:  It beggars \nbelief that the legally relevant (i.e., proximate) cause \nof an accident several States away could somehow be \nthe Uinta Basin Railway\u2014and not, for instance, the \nengineer of the relevant train, the train manufacturer, \nor the operator of the relevant track.  Even if the \nproject could be said to be the but-for cause, a tort \nplaintiff suing the agency or the Uinta Basin Railway \nfor a train accident a thousand miles away (let alone \nfor climate change) would be laughed out of court.  The \nresult should be no different just because plaintiffs \nchallenge an EIS under NEPA.  \u201c\u2018[F]or want of a nail, \na kingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \n\n18 \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv\u2019r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nThe decision below also defies NEPA\u2019s \u201cpractical \n\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u201d  N.Y. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. \nKleppe, 97 S.Ct. 4, 6 (1976) (decision of Marshall, J.).  \nNEPA requires agencies to consider proposals \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), not track down \nevery remote or minimal impact.  As one moves from \nthe direct effects of the project to increasingly remote \neffects and mere risks, the agency has discretion to \nignore them or give them more cursory treatment, and \nthe rule of reason prevents a court from forcing an \nagency to consider \u201cinformation\u201d that the agency \ndeems of little \u201cvalue\u201d to the \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374 \n(1989).  For example, whatever the proper solution to \nglobal climate change, the issue must be addressed \nglobally (or at least nationally by EPA), not by \nblocking an 88-mile rail line bringing much-needed \neconomic stability and development to a remote corner \nof Utah.  In practical terms, \u201cno rule of reason worthy \nof that title,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767, would \n\u201coblige\u201d an agency responsible for approving rail \nprojects \n\u201cto \nexpend \nconsiderable \nresources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise\u201d on issues \u201cnot otherwise \nrelevant to [its] congressionally assigned functions,\u201d \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776; see also Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 769.   \nThe decision below is a poster child for converting \na sensible procedural check into a morass that \n\n19 \noperates as a substantive roadblock to development.  \nThe clearest way to put an end to this excess is for this \nCourt to reverse and make clear that the EIS here is \nsufficient.  88 miles of track should not require 3,600 \npages of EIS, let alone a remand for further study of \nwildly remote matters.  This Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nText And Precedent Answer The Question \nPresented In The Negative. \nA. This \nCourt \nHas \nMade \nClear \nThat \nProximate Cause and a Rule of Reason \nSensibly Limit the Scope of NEPA \nReview. \n1. This Court decided Metropolitan Edison in \n1983, four years after a high-profile accident at the \nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant prompted mass \nevacuations and a national reckoning about the safety \nof nuclear power.  Immediately following the accident, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) ordered \nthe power company to shutter the plant indefinitely.  \n460 U.S. at 769.  When the power company sought \npermission to resume operations, the Atomic Energy \nAct required NRC to act as \u201cnecessary or desirable \u2026 \nto protect health or to minimize danger to life or \nproperty.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b).  NEPA also required \nthe Commission to prepare an EIS.  In Metropolitan \nEdison, this Court addressed what environmental \nimpacts NRC needed to consider under NEPA before \nauthorizing Three Mile Island operations to resume. \nThe Court began with statutory text.  Under the \nversion then in effect, NEPA required agencies to \nstudy \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmental effects which \n\n20 \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1975).  As \nthen-Justice Rehnquist explained, this language did \nnot mean that NEPA required the Commission to \nconsider every possible adverse effect of restarting \nThree Mile Island.  460 U.S. at 774.  Rather, \u201cthe \nterms \u2018environmental effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental \nimpact\u2019\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u201d \nakin \nto \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d \u201cbetween\u201d the agency action \u201cand \nthe effect at issue.\u201d  Id.; see also Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 \n(2014) (explaining the settled principle that federal \nstatutes often should be \u201cconstrued \u2026 to incorporate a \nrequirement of proximate causation\u201d). \nWith that statutory construction in hand, the \nCourt unanimously concluded that things like the \n\u201crelease of low-level radiation, increased fog in the \nHarrisburg area (caused by operation of the plant\u2019s \ncooling towers), and the release of warm water into the \nSusquehanna River\u201d were properly on the table for \nNEPA purposes.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775.  \nThese effects, after all, were \u201cproximately related\u201d to \nthe plant resuming operations.  Id. at 774.   \nOn the flip side, the Commission\u2019s EIS did not \nneed to account for \u201cthe potential psychological health \neffects\u201d of reopening the plant on members of the \nsurrounding community, let alone the impact on far-\nflung relatives living hundreds or thousands of miles \naway.  Id. at 771, 774, 777-78.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court did not deny that locals were \nstill reeling from the recent brush with disaster, or \nthat reopening the plant \u201cmay well cause\u201d residents to \n\n21 \nsuffer \n\u201cpsychological \nhealth \nproblems \n\u2026 \nand \naccompanying physical disorders\u201d that derive from \n\u201c\u2018tension and fear.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 774.  But NEPA is \nconcerned with effects of agency action on \u201cthe \nphysical environment\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201c\u2018the air, land and \nwater\u2019\u201d\u2014and such harms were \u201csimply too remote \nfrom the physical environment to justify requiring the \nNRC to evaluate the psychological health damage \u2026 \nthat may be caused by renewed operation of [the \nplant].\u201d  Id. at 773, 774 (emphasis omitted). \nFurthermore, the resumption of operations was \nnot the proximate cause of the health effects \nrespondents raised; those effects instead would \u201cflow \ndirectly from the risk of [a nuclear] accident.\u201d  Id. at \n775 (emphasis added; alteration in original) (quoting \nMetro. Edison Br. for Resps. 23).  \u201cBut a risk of an \naccident is not an effect on the physical environment\u201d \neither.  Id.  \u201cA risk is, by definition, unrealized in the \nphysical world.\u201d  Id. at 767.  What matters under \nNEPA\u2014and what defines the scope of review\u2014is the \nrelationship between the project at issue and changes \nin the physical environment caused by it.  \u201cNEPA does \nnot require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua \nrisk,\u201d of a project moving forward, as opposed to the \nreasonably foreseeable effects of the project itself.  Id. \nat 779.   \nFinally, the Court warned against allowing NEPA \nto be converted into a vehicle for environmental policy \ndisputes.  \u201cThe political process, and not NEPA, \nprovides the appropriate forum in which to air policy \ndisagreements.\u201d  Id. at 777. \nMetropolitan Edison all but resolves this case.  If \nNEPA did not require consideration of allegedly direct \n\n22 \nhealth consequences of the ripped-from-the-headlines \nrisk of another nuclear meltdown before restarting \nThree Mile Island, then it is hard to demand that \nSTB\u2019s EIS here consider the risk of accidents on \nexisting tracks hundreds of miles away, let alone the \nremote and theoretical risk that the Uinta Basin \nRailway could cause future harm to communities near \nGulf Coast refineries.  But if any doubt remained post-\nMetropolitan Edison, Public Citizen settled it. \n2. The question in Public Citizen was whether, \nwhen deciding what safety regulations should govern \nMexican trucks operating in the United States, the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration needed \nto consider the Mexican trucks\u2019 contribution to \ndomestic air pollution.  541 U.S. at 756.  Unlike \nMetropolitan Edison, the question was not risk\u2014e.g., \nthe \nrisk \nthat \nMexican \ntrucks \nwould \nhave \nenvironmentally damaging accidents in the United \nStates or impact traffic patterns in ways that affected \ndistant communities\u2014but the certainty that Mexican \ntrucks would cause additional air pollution.  After all, \nthe regulations were the last thing standing in the \nway of President Bush\u2019s directive to allow Mexican \ntrucks to operate in the United States.  Id. at 765-66.   \nNevertheless, even though the agency action was \nplainly the but-for cause of that increased pollution, \nthe Court concluded that it landed outside NEPA\u2019s \nrequired scope.  Id. at 770.  The Court clarified that \u201ca \n\u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is insufficient to make an \nagency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA \nand the relevant regulations.\u201d  Id. at 767.  Rather, \nNEPA requires agencies to consider only those effects \nproximately caused by the proposed action.  Id.  Given \n\n23 \nthe President\u2019s order, the agency could not simply \ndecline to issue regulations, and so\u2014while the agency \naction allowing the Mexican trucks into the country \nwas plainly a but-for cause of increased pollution\u2014\n\u201cthe President,\u201d \u201cnot\u201d any \u201caction\u201d by the agency, was \n\u201cthe legally relevant cause.\u201d  Id. at 760-61, 769; see \nalso id. at 767 (noting that \u201cproximate cause analysis \nturns on,\u201d among other things, \u201cconsiderations of the \n\u2018legal responsibility\u2019 of actors\u201d (quoting W. Page \nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 275 \n(5th ed. 1984))). \nThe Court likewise invoked NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason,\u201d which ensures that agencies need not engage \nin endless environmental reviews that would frustrate \nthe agency\u2019s primary mission or \u201cserve no purpose in \nlight of NEPA\u2019s regulatory scheme as a whole.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents there argued that while the President\u2019s \ndecision required the agency to allow the trucks into \nthe country, the agency still needed to consider \npollution, on the theory that it might matter on the \nmargins when selecting among the menu of possible \nsafety regulations.  This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would require an \nagency\u201d against its will to study environmental effects \nfalling outside its \u201cability to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 767, 770.   \n3. Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen suffice \nto resolve this case in petitioners\u2019 favor, but they are \nfar from the only decisions of this Court holding that \nonly proximate environmental effects count, and an \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis need not consider remote \nenvironmental effects, non-environmental effects, \npure risk, or matters beyond the agency\u2019s remit. \n\n24 \nIn Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \nfor instance, the Forest Service authorized the \ndevelopment of a major new ski resort in a \u201csparsely \npopulated area\u201d of the Cascade Mountains.  490 U.S. \nat 337.  The resort quickly got bogged down in \nlitigation.  Environmental groups challenged the \nadequacy of the EIS, which recognized that off-site \ndevelopment on private land \u201ccould \u2026 degrad[e] \u2026 \nexisting air quality\u201d but did not delve deeply into the \nair-quality issue.  Id. at 339-40, 344-45.  They further \nargued the EIS needed to conduct a \u201cworst case\u201d \nanalysis of impacts to the local mule-deer population \nand that the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that those \neffects were \u201cuncertain[]\u201d did not suffice.  Id. at 343, \n347.  This Court rejected both arguments with a nod \nto NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Because the county, not \nthe Forest Service, had primary jurisdiction over air \nquality, \u201c[t]he off-site effects on air quality and on the \nmule deer herd\u201d would \u201cbe subject to regulation by \nother \ngovernmental \nbodies\u201d \nwith \nprimary \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the effects and \u201cauthority to \nmitigate them.\u201d  Id. at 350, 352.  \u201c[I]t would be \nincongruous to conclude that the Forest Service\u201d was \nresponsible to develop related mitigation measures.  \nId. at 352-53.2 \n \n2 Unfortunately, that conclusion was not enough to save the \nresort:  Despite heralding the region as \u201cthe best potential \ndestination ski resort in the United States,\u201d Aspen Ski \nCorporation ultimately \u201cbec[a]me weary of the seemingly never-\nending lawsuits\u201d and sold the property to another developer, who \nitself \u201cran out of cash\u201d after \u201cspen[ding] roughly $12 million on \nland and legal fees.\u201d  Ryan Flynn, Early Winters Resort, WA:  A \nSki Hill That Never Was, SnowBrains (Jan. 8, 2024), \n \n\n25 \nThe Court reached a similar conclusion for similar \nreasons in Vermont Yankee.  There, the Court brushed \nback the suggestion that an EIS must \u201cferret out every \npossible\u201d way to mitigate environmental effects, \nparticularly when those effects fall into the domain of \n\u201cstate public utility commissions or similar bodies.\u201d  \n435 U.S. at 550-51, 558.  And in Baltimore Gas and \nElectric, this Court blessed NRC\u2019s use of generic rules \nto evaluate the environmental effects of nuclear power \ngeneration generally, rather than via a power-plant-\nspecific analysis.  As the Court there put it, \u201cCongress \ndid not enact NEPA \u2026 so that an agency would \ncontemplate the environmental impact of an action as \nan abstract exercise\u201d; agencies \u201cha[ve] discretion\u201d \nunder \nNEPA \nto \n\u201ccho[ose]\u201d \nto \n\u201cevaluate \n\u2026 \nenvironmental impact[s]\u201d \u201cgenerically,\u201d rather than \nspecifically, to \u201cfurther[]\u201d \u201c[a]dministrative efficiency \nand consistency of decision.\u201d  462 U.S. at 100-01. \n* * * \nThe lessons of this Court\u2019s NEPA cases are clear, \nyet they all seemed lost on the D.C. Circuit in its \ndecision below.  NEPA requires agencies to study only \nenvironmental effects proximately caused by the \nproposed agency action.  NEPA does not require \nagencies to study remote environmental effects, non-\nenvironmental effects, risks, or factors outside the \nagency\u2019s control.  Nor does an agency have to consider \nevery effect that may (or may not) flow from conduct \nor events that a proposed project may (or may not) \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4fAPp9W.  That result underscores the risk that \nNEPA litigation allows environmental opponents of agency-\napproved projects to lose the NEPA battle while still winning the \nwar of attrition. \n\n26 \nspur, just because the agency could ensure that those \npotential future consequences never arise by denying \na permit and cutting off the proposed action \naltogether.  Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nboth say so directly and confirm that the D.C. Circuit \nerred in requiring STB to consider far-downstream \nconsequences as part of its NEPA review.   \nThat proximate-cause limit tethered to the project \nitself is buttressed by NEPA\u2019s rule of reason, which \nputs sensible limits on what an agency must study.  In \nPublic Citizen, even though pollution from Mexican \ntrucks was a certain, direct environmental effect of the \nFederal \nMotor \nCarrier \nSafety \nAdministration \npromulgating its safety regulations, the agency did \nnot need to study pollution from increased truck \ntraffic, because the agency \u201cha[d] no statutory \nauthority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to \nestablish environmental requirements unrelated to \nmotor carrier safety.\u201d  541 U.S. at 759.  Likewise in \nRobertson, even if air pollution from off-site \ndevelopment was a certain, direct environmental \neffect of licensing the ski resort, the Forest Service \nwould not need to study it, because it would fall within \nthe County\u2019s authority.  Once again, those cases \nconfirm that the D.C. Circuit erred in holding that \nSTB must conduct a full-scale NEPA review of issues \nfar outside its limited remit, but well within the \npurview of other agencies\u2019 authority\u2014especially when \nthose other agencies can address such issues more \ncomprehensively, rather than making a relatively \nmodest infrastructure project the scapegoat for \neverything from upstream mining to downstream \naccident risks and climate change. \n\n27 \nB. The \nBUILDER \nAct \nButtresses \nthe \nLimitations on NEPA Review That This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Recognize and Enforce. \nThis Court has long \u201capplied the standard \nrequirement of proximate cause to actions under \nfederal statutes\u201d even though \u201cthe text did not \nexpressly provide for it.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nMcBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting).  As of 2023, NEPA\u2019s text does provide for \nit.  While not directly applicable to this pre-Act project, \nCongress codified in the BUILDER Act what this \nCourt has long held, making clear that the scope of \nNEPA \nreview \nturns \non \nforeseeability \nand \nreasonableness\u2014i.e., proximate cause\u2014and that \nNEPA does not alter statutory provisions delimiting \nan agency\u2019s authority or mission. \nAs amended by the BUILDER Act, NEPA now \nprovides as follows: \n(2) [A]ll agencies of the Federal Government \nshall\u2014 \n(C) \u2026 except where compliance would be \ninconsistent \nwith \nother \nstatutory \nrequirements, \ninclude \nin \nevery \nrecommendation or report on proposals for \nlegislation and other major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on\u2014 \n(i) \nthe \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nenvironmental impact effects of the \nproposed agency action,; \n\n28 \n(ii) \nany \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal be implemented,; [and] \n(iii) \na \nreasonable \nrange \nof \nalternatives to the proposed agency \naction, including an analysis of any \nnegative environmental impacts of \nnot \nimplementing \nthe \nproposed \nagency action in the case of a no \naction \nalternative, \nthat \nare \ntechnically \nand \neconomically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposal[.]  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332 (2023) (additions underlined; \ndeletions stricken). \nThese \nclarifying \nchanges \nunderscore \nthat \nCongress has embraced this Court\u2019s decisions, which \nkeep NEPA as a manageable procedural check, rather \nthan a substantive roadblock to infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The BUILDER Act makes explicit what \nthis Court already held was implicit by textually \nadopting the language of proximate cause.  See, e.g., \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) \n(proximate cause is \u201coften explicated in terms of \nforeseeability\u201d).  That strongly reinforces this Court\u2019s \ndecisions.  After all, if Congress can \u201ccarry forward\u201d \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nstatutory \nprecedents \nmerely \nby \n\u201cperpetuating the [same] wording\u201d (i.e., doing nothing \nin response to this Court\u2019s statutory decisions), then \nCongress\u2019 affirmative choice to adopt new language \nembracing prior statutory precedents of this Court \nsupplies a strong signal that those precedents were \n\n29 \ncorrect.  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \nThe BUILDER Act likewise embraces the rule of \nreason recognized in Public Citizen.  The Act\u2019s title \nunderscores Congress\u2019 intent for NEPA review to be \nnarrow and efficient, rather than unwieldy and anti-\ndevelopment.  See id. at 221 (noting that statutory \ntitles provide a \u201cpermissible indicator[] of meaning\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the Act continues to limit NEPA to projects \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and it now \nexpressly \nabsolves \nagencies \nof \nconsidering \nalternatives \nthat \nare \nnot \n\u201creasonable,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) (2023), and presumptively limits the \nEIS process to no more than \u201c2 years\u201d and an EIS itself \nto \u201c150 pages,\u201d id. \u00a74336a(e)(1), (g)(1).  What is more, \nit makes explicit that when Congress assigns an \nagency to administer a decidedly pro-development \nstatute\u2014as \nit \nhas \ndone \nwith \nSTB \nand \nrail \nconstruction, see p.10, supra\u2014NEPA does not stand in \nthe way; the agency need only weigh alternatives that \n\u201cmeet the purpose and need of the proposal\u201d and \nevaluate the cost of doing nothing.  Id. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) \n(2023).   \nAt bottom, the BUILDER Act not only endorses \nthis Court\u2019s focus on proximate cause and underscores \nthat limits on an agency\u2019s regulatory mission and its \nsubject-matter portfolio are baked into the rule of \nreason, but illustrates the folly in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nboil-the-ocean mandate here. \n\n30 \nII. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA And This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Applying It.   \nThis Court\u2019s NEPA precedents and Congress\u2019 \nrecent and emphatic reaffirmation of them confirm \nthat NEPA envisions a procedural cross-check, not a \nsubstantive roadblock.  And NEPA\u2019s procedural cross-\ncheck is not designed to be unduly onerous or to \nresemble a Sisyphean task, where there is always one \nadditional and increasingly remote effect or risk that \nmust be considered.  To the contrary, NEPA strikes a \nsensible balance where an agency need only consider \nproximate environmental effects and judgments about \nwhat to consider are protected from endless second-\nguessing by a rule of reason.  Striking this balance \nensures that NEPA will continue to facilitate \u201cfully \ninformed and well-considered decision[s]\u201d while \nremaining \u201cbounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551, 558.  It likewise ensures that \n\u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA, provides the \nappropriate \nforum \nin \nwhich \nto \nair \npolicy \ndisagreements\u201d with a project that meets all the \nsubstantive criteria for agency approval.  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 777. \nThe decision below upsets that balance and \nthreatens to block vital infrastructure development \nunder the guise of just a little more process.  The \nimpact (if any) of 88 new miles of track in an isolated \ncorner of Utah on train accidents hundreds of miles \naway or the air quality of refining communities on the \nGulf Coast or on climate change is the very definition \nof remote, not proximate, cause.  And despite the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s view that NEPA demands a never-ending \nprocess, it was eminently reasonable for an agency \n\n31 \nresponsible for administering an explicitly pro-\ndevelopment statute to decline to consider de minimis \nenvironmental impacts that are little more than the \ninevitable consequences of development and that \nshould be regulated (if at all) as part of a \ncomprehensive scheme administered by a different \nagency.  To state the obvious, the solution to the global \nissue of climate change does not lie in blocking 88 \nmiles of track or keeping the Uinta Basin isolated from \nthe national economy.   \nA. The \nDecision \nBelow \nDemanded \nConsideration of Non-Proximate and \nNon-Environmental Effects. \n1. If a train collision occurs in the middle of \nColorado and winds up in court, there are plenty of \npotential tort defendants:  the hapless train engineer, \nthe careless builder of the malfunctioning train, the \nmanufacturer of the unsafe track, the negligent \ndispatcher who was on duty, or perhaps even the \nreckless safety regulator who ignored advice to lower \nthe relevant speed limit.  Only the most creative of \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2014and least successful, given the \nwell-established limits of proximate cause\u2014would \nthink to sue the operator of an 88-mile rail line that \nbegins and ends in rural Utah or the regulator who \napproved it on the theory that it increased downline \naccident risk by less than a percentage point. \nThat would be true a fortiori for consequences on \nthe ground (or in the air above it) from increased waxy \ncrude refining on the Gulf Coast\u2014and doubly so of \neffects of such refining on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as \nchanges or increases in refining are strictly regulated \nby other agencies.  Not even Helen Palsgraf could have \n\n32 \ndreamed of a judicial opinion finding 88 miles of track \nwholly in rural Utah to be the proximate cause of \nfuture air pollution on the Gulf Coast and its \nramifications for Gulf refining communities\u2014to say \nnothing of one linking the railway to monsoons in the \nSouth Pacific.   \nWhile well-established principles of proximate \ncause would stop such fanciful lawsuits at the starting \ngate, the D.C. Circuit put STB on the hook for \nstudying similarly remote effects of approving 88 \nmiles of rail line in rural Utah.  The D.C. Circuit \njustified that burden not by expressly finding air \npollution on the Gulf Coast or downline accidents to be \nproximately caused by the project, but by emphasizing \nthat STB has the authority to deny the permit \nnecessary for the project if it \u201cfinds that such activities \nare inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d  See Pet.App.36a-37a; 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901(c). \nThat analytical leap hopelessly conflates but-for \nand proximate cause.  An agency can avoid any \nnumber of remote impacts and risks of harmful \nactivity by denying a required permit, because the \nvery nature of a permit makes it a necessary but-for \ncause of the permitted activity.  But this Court has \nrepeatedly rejected the notion that NEPA embodies \nsuch a \u201c\u2018but-for\u2019 causation\u201d standard.  Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 767.  In its place, and in order to protect \nthe \u201cmanageable\u201d and balanced approach that \nCongress intended, see Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776, \nNEPA requires agencies to study only proximate \nenvironmental effects.  In light of \u201cthe congressional \nconcerns that led to the enactment of NEPA,\u201d \u201c[s]ome \neffects\u201d of a proposed project \u201cthat are \u2018caused by\u2019 a \n\n33 \nchange in the physical environment in the sense of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation, will nonetheless not fall within [NEPA] \nbecause the causal chain is too attenuated.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nStated more succinctly, proximate cause is the \ntouchstone for an EIS\u2014and where proximate cause \nends, so ends the scope of what NEPA requires.   \nMoreover, as this Court has emphasized, the focus \nof the proximate-cause inquiry is on the project itself, \nnot on subsequent activities a project may someday \nenable.  See id. at 771-79; pp.20-21, supra.  NEPA \nrequires \u201ca detailed statement\u201d of \u201cthe environmental \nimpact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2019) \n(emphases added).3  Thus, \u201cto decide what kind of an \n[EIS] need be prepared, it is necessary first to describe \naccurately the \u2026 \u2018action\u2019 being taken.\u201d  Aberdeen & \nRockfish R.R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U.S. 289, 322 (1975); \nsee also Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 395-402 \n(1976).  And the same is true for the proximate-cause \ninquiry.  \u201cTo determine whether [NEPA] requires \nconsideration of a particular effect, we must look at \nthe relationship between that effect and the change in \nthe physical environment caused by the major federal \naction at issue.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773 \n(emphasis added).  What matters, in other words, is \nthe relationship between the project and changes in \nthe physical environment caused by it.  \n \n3 The language under the BUILDER Act is substantially \nsimilar.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2023) (requiring \u201ca detailed \nstatement\u201d of, inter alia, \u201creasonably foreseeable environmental \neffects of the proposed agency action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed agency action\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnder that rubric, changes in the physical \nenvironment that have a reasonably close causal \nrelationship to a proposed project must be considered \nas part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review.  But changes in \nthe physical environment that are remote from a \nproposed project in space and time need not be \nconsidered as part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review, \nbecause \nthose \neffects \nare, \nby \ndefinition, \nnot \nproximately caused by the project.  Likewise, \nenvironmental effects that flow from subsequent \nactions that the project may (or may not) ultimately \nenable need not be considered under NEPA, as such \nuncertain potentialities likewise lie well beyond the \nscope of proximate environmental effects. \nThat sensible proximate-cause limit focused on \nthe project itself is reinforced by NEPA\u2019s direction to \nconsider alternatives.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii).  \nIt makes perfect sense for an agency to consider three \nalternative rail routes to connect the Uinta Basin with \nthe national rail system, as well as a no-action \nalternative.  See pp.11-13, supra.  If one route \nendangers important habitat or threatens a pristine \nriver, then the EIS helpfully directs the agency to an \nalternative.  But it is completely infeasible to consider \nevery alternative for the cargo that could be carried on \ndistant rail lines, the development the rail line could \nprecipitate in the Uinta Basin, or the permutations for \nthe mix and quantity of crude refined on the Gulf \nCoast.  And NEPA directs agencies to consider all \nalternatives in the same manner, not to go to the ends \nof the Earth vis-\u00e0-vis the principal proposal and give \nonly cursory consideration to the alternatives.  Thus, \nthe only conclusion consistent with NEPA\u2019s text and \nthe imperative to keep NEPA analysis within \n\n35 \nreasonable bounds is to consider only a manageable \nrange of proximate environmental effects of all \nalternatives.  Any other conclusion would leave \nagencies (and courts) with impossible burdens and \nwithout \u201ca manageable line between those causal \nchanges that may make an actor responsible for an \neffect and those that do not.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7). \n2. The D.C. Circuit lost sight of these important \nprinciples here.  The court of appeals perceived three \nfailings in the EIS:  failing to adequately consider \n(1) \u201cthe effects of increased crude oil refining on Gulf \nCoast \ncommunities \nin \nLouisiana \nand \nTexas\u201d; \n(2) \u201cdownline effects of projected increases in spills \nand accidents from additional oil trains traveling the \nexisting Union Pacific rail line\u201d; and (3) the \u201cupline \nimpacts on vegetation or special status species\u201d that \nmight be found near potential well sites if the new \nrailway \nspurs \nindependent \ndevelopment.  \nPet.App.12a-13a; see also Pet.App.30a-37a, 40a-47a.   \nJust quoting those supposedly \u201comitted\u201d impacts \nconfirms that the D.C. Circuit went well beyond \nproximate environmental effects of adding 88 miles of \nrail in rural Utah.  First, any impact on Gulf Coast \ncommunities in Louisiana and Texas is wildly remote \nin multiple dimensions.  There are multiple States, \nand more than a thousand miles, between the 88 miles \nof track in Utah and the Gulf Coast.   \nAnd there is arguably an even greater gap \nbetween the project and any material increase in \ncrude oil refining in those remote areas.  Even \ncrediting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s apparent assumption that \nall crude shipped on a common-carrier rail line will \n\n36 \nend up at a specific destination in the Gulf Coast, \nwhether there will even be an increase in crude oil \nrefining on the Gulf Coast depends on the amount of \nwaxy crude shipped on the new line and how that \ncompares to the status quo ante with truck \ntransportation, see CADCJA230, \u201cthe ability and \nwillingness\u201d of the refineries in those areas to receive \nand process waxy crude oil, JA477, and (among many \nother things) the actions of myriad local, state, and \nfederal regulators who already directly oversee the \nrefineries\u2019 operations.  Figuring out \u201cthe climate \neffects of the combustion of the fuel intended to be \nextracted\u201d thus depends on guessing which part (or \nparts) of the Gulf Coast might receive and refine the \noil; speculating whether and to what degree waxy \ncrude from the Uinta Basin will augment existing \nrefining activity, rather than just displace refining \ncrude from elsewhere (and, if so, what kind of crude is \ndisplaced); estimating the relative impacts of refining \none form of crude versus another; and then inferring \nthat the environmental protections already in place \n(due to action by EPA and state regulators, not STB) \nwould fail to protect the surrounding community from \nany marginal increase in refining output.  All of those \nare \u201cmiddle links\u201d that render \u201cthe effects of increased \ncrude oil refining on Gulf Coast communities in \nLouisiana and Texas\u201d far too remote from a new \nrailway line in rural Utah and far too speculative to \njustify NEPA review of those highly contingent \npotentialities.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775. \nThe \u201cdownline\u201d effects of STB\u2019s decision are, if \nanything, even more contingent and remote.  As part \nof its NEPA review, STB used models to predict how \nmany trains would be added to other rail lines.  Based \n\n37 \non that prediction, STB estimated that the additional \ntrain cars would result in less than one\u20140.89, to be \nexact\u2014additional \ntrain \naccident \neach \nyear.  \nPet.App.40a-41a.  And even that number oversells the \npoint.  Where such an accident would occur; whether \nit would be serious or minor; whether it would involve \ncars that were empty or full; and whether it would \ncause any damage to the physical environment \nhundreds or thousands of miles removed from the \nUinta Basin are all matters of complete guesswork.  As \nnoted, any plaintiff trying to sue the operators of the \n88 miles of rural Utah track (or STB) for a train \naccident in Colorado, Louisiana, or anywhere in \nbetween would be laughed out of court.  The most that \ncould be said is that STB approval of the 88 miles at \nissue here was a but-for cause of the future accident.  \nTo argue that the accident was a proximate \nenvironmental effect drains those words of meaning \nand defies this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThe same is true of the potential that, if the \nrailway spurs new development in the Uinta Basin, \nthat new development may have effects on the \nsurrounding environs.  See Pet.App.31a.  Initially, \nthat risk depends on the assumption that the new rail \nline will carry substantial amounts of waxy crude\u2014by \nno means a certainty, as evidenced by the fact that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity previously contended \nthat market demand for oil could never sustain the \nrailway. \n \nSee \nPet.App.197a-198a. \n \nAnd \nthe \nassumptions spin out from there.  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nown \ndescription \nof \nSTB\u2019s \nsupposed \nomissions \nunderscores that it has gone well beyond proximate \nenvironmental effects of the project itself.  The D.C. \nCircuit demanded consideration of \u201cas yet unknown \n\n38 \nand unplanned independent projects that would occur \non as yet unidentified private, state, tribal, or federal \nland,\u201d \u201cundertaken \u2018by as yet unknown entities and \nlicensed or permitted by other federal agencies, state \nand local governments, or the Ute Tribe, depending on \nthe location of the development,\u2019\u201d at a level that is \n\u201csimply unknown and unknowable.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(quoting CADC.Gov.Br.35-36).  The court should have \nstopped well before the fourth \u201cunknown.\u201d  None of \nthose unknowns is a proximate consequence of the \nproject, as opposed to a potential consequence of \nindependent development that the project may (or \nmay not) spur and that could pose some harm to the \nenvironment, \ndespite \nwhatever \nenvironmental \nanalysis is required if, and when, any concrete future \nprojects materialize. \nTo be sure, an agency must make some educated \nassumptions about environmental effects that are \ncertain but hard to quantify, to \u201censure[] that [those] \nimportant \neffects \nwill \nnot \nbe \noverlooked \nor \nunderestimated,\u201d and to \u201cprovide[] a springboard for \npublic comment.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.  In \nMetropolitan Edison, for example, NRC needed to \nmake educated assumptions about the \u201crelease of low-\nlevel radiation, increased fog in the [surrounding] area \n(caused by operation of the plant\u2019s cooling towers), and \nthe release of warm water into [a nearby] River.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 775.  But those were all actual effects of the \nproject itself.  Environmental consequences that may \n(or may not) arise if a project spurs other conduct (i.e., \nother non-environmental consequences) are not \nproximate effects of a project.  The project may be their \nbut-for cause\u2014but if one thing is clear in this context, \n\n39 \nit is that but-for cause is not enough.  The D.C. Circuit \nignored that critical limitation here.4 \nIndeed, the decision below ended up light-years \naway from any recognizable notion of proximate cause.  \nAccording to the court, the \u201cforeseeable environmental \neffects of the project\u201d include \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at new \noil wells that do not yet exist, but that may (or may not) \nbe constructed if the project is approved and it \nincreases demand for waxy crude from the Uinta \nBasin.  Pet.App.66a.  It would be a stretch to argue \nthat 88 miles of rail is the proximate cause of the \nextraction of any fuel, given the myriad factors that go \ninto energy extraction (market demands, emergence of \nnew technology, business expansion and contraction, \njust to name a few).  It would take proximate causation \nwell past its breaking point to try to connect the new \nrail with \u201cthe combustion\u201d of said fuel.  Yet the D.C. \nCircuit went further still, asserting that the new rail \nis the proximate cause of the climate effects of such \ncombustion.  That \u201csounds absurd, because it is.\u201d  \nSekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 738 (2013). \n3. The problems with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nrun deeper still.  NEPA requires consideration only of \n \n4 The regulations in effect at the relevant time here defined \n\u201ceffects\u201d to include both direct and indirect effects, with the latter \nencompassing effects \u201clater in time or farther removed in \ndistance\u201d than the former.  40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.8(a)-(b) (2019).  But \n\u201ceffects\u201d still must be effects of the project itself\u2014and even the \nindirect effects must \u201cstill [be] reasonably foreseeable,\u201d id. \n\u00a71508.8(b), i.e., proximately related to the agency action and \nproject at issue.  To the extent the courts of appeals have \ninterpreted the phrase \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d more broadly, \nthey have misapplied this Court\u2019s decisions. \n\n40 \nproximate effects of proposed projects on the physical \nenvironment, i.e., \u201cthe air, land and water.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772-73 (emphasis removed).  \u201cIf a \nharm does not have a sufficiently close connection to \nthe physical environment, NEPA does not apply.\u201d  Id. \nat 778.  Put simply, what matters is a project\u2019s \nproximate environmental effects; non-environmental \neffects, even if proximate, need not be considered.  The \ndecision \nbelow \ncannot \nbe \nsquared \nwith \nthat \nfundamental limitation on NEPA review. \nTake the risk of downline train accidents.  Even \nassuming that a new, 88-mile railway in rural Utah \nmight be the but-for cause of additional traffic on rail \nlines hundreds of miles distant, which in turn might \neventually contribute to an accident that would not \nhave occurred if the Uinta Basin remained cut off from \nthe national rail system, it does not follow that the \naccident would have any meaningful impact on the \n\u201cair, land and water.\u201d  If the train cars were unloaded \nor carrying innocuous cargo, there would be a safety \nrisk for the Federal Railway Administration to \nconsider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.  \n\u201cNEPA does not require the agency to assess every \nimpact or effect of its proposed action, but only the \nimpact or effect on the environment.\u201d  Id. at 772. \nAt most, then, the D.C. Circuit could only have \nrequired STB to reconsider (the vanishingly narrow \nand remote universe of) downline accidents actually \naffecting the physical environment.  But even limiting \nthe remand to train accidents actually impacting the \nphysical environment does not solve the problem; it \njust highlights that the decision below forces STB to \n\n41 \nevaluate \u201crisk, qua risk.\u201d  See id. at 779.  NEPA \nrequires STB \u201cto prepare an EIS evaluating\u201d harms \nthat are \u201cproximately related to a change in the \nphysical environment.\u201d  Id. at 774.  But the only \nreasonably foreseeable effect of connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the broader national rail system is that \nthere likely will be a very small number of new \naccidents.  That is not an environmental effect at all. \n* * * \nAll told, this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents make clear \nthat the metes and bounds of what an agency must \nanalyze under NEPA should be cabined by what is \nnecessary for the statute to fulfill its important, but \nlimited, mission:  \u201cto promote human welfare by \nalerting governmental actors to the effect of their \nproposed actions on the physical environment.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772.  That makes this case \nstraightforward.  To the extent the proposed project \nhas actual environmental effects that are reasonably \nforeseeable consequences of the project itself, those \neffects must be analyzed (and, as explained, they were \nand then some).  But to the extent the project has non-\nenvironmental effects\u2014ranging from spurring new \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin, to (an infinitesimally \nsmall number of) increased rail accidents downline, to \na change in the quantity or mix of refining activities \non the Gulf Coast\u2014the risk of some environmental \nharm from those activities need not be considered \nunder NEPA.  Thus, in concrete terms, since \napproving the track could cross a critical habitat, \ncontribute to air pollution in the Uinta Basin, or \nchange the topography in a way that causes run-off to \nenter a mountain lake, STB properly studied these \n\n42 \nadverse effects of the project, relying as necessary on \ninput from other agencies, reasonable forecasting, and \neducated assumptions.  But it just as properly \ndeclined to go further to consider risks beyond the \neffect of the proposed action \u201con the physical \nenvironment.\u201d  See id. \nNo one\u2014save, perhaps, project opponents who \nbenefit from delay\u2014would be served by a system \n\u201crequir[ing] detailed discussion of \u2026 effects [that] \ncannot be readily ascertained\u201d in a way that is \n\u201c[in]compatible with the time-frame of the needs to \nwhich the underlying proposal is addressed.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551.  And even if agencies did turn \nover every speculative rock (although there is always \nthe possibility of studying the next-most remote and \nspeculative risk), the resulting EISs would skew \ndecisionmaking by overemphasizing \u201csmall, often \nirrelevant, losses from the proposed new projects,\u201d and \nallowing them to distract from \u201cthe gains [in] \nenvironmental innovation.\u201d  Richard A. Epstein, The \nMany Sins of NEPA, 6 Tex. A&M L. Rev. 1, 3 (2018). \nIn short, \u201c[t]he scope of the agency\u2019s inquiries \nmust remain manageable if NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018ensur[ing] \na fully informed and well considered decision\u2019 is to be \naccomplished.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. \nat 558).  The decision below defies that imperative. \nB. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA\u2019s Rule \nof Reason. \nAs the preceding section explains, the lack of \nproximate cause and actual environmental effects \nfrom the project suffice to explain why STB did not \nneed to consider the three \u201comissions\u201d identified by the \n\n43 \nD.C Circuit.  But STB actually did exercise its \ndiscretion to consider some of these issues in its EIS.  \nFor example, STB used models to predict how many \ntrains would be added to other rail lines, as well as \n\u201cnational data for train accident rates\u201d to predict \nmarginal \nrisks \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \ntrains.  \nPet.App.40a.  The Board likewise employed maps of \nwildfire potential to conclude that the risk of downline \nfires was miniscule.  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s real gripe was not that these effects went \nunstudied, but rather that the court felt that STB \nshould have gone further in its studies.  That is a rule \nof bottomless process, not a rule of reason\u2014and it \ndefies this Court\u2019s precedents.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas, 462 U.S. at 103 (\u201cA reviewing court should not \nmagnify a single line item beyond its significance as \nonly part of a larger Table.\u201d). \nIndeed, when it came to the environmental effects \non communities on the Gulf Coast, the D.C. Circuit \nwent even further and effectively punished STB for \ngoing beyond what NEPA requires.  Given that any \nenvironmental effect on Gulf Coast communities is \nremote and speculative, STB could have simply \ndismissed any such effect as hopelessly remote.  Cf. \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 (rejecting any need to \nconsider psychological effects on far-flung relatives of \nlocal residents).  But STB nonetheless went beyond \nthe call of legal duty to try to trace potential increases \nin waxy crude production to refineries on the Gulf \nCoast, while disclaiming any ability to identify \nparticular refineries.  Applying the no-good-deed-goes-\nunpunished rule of Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat by tracing the waxy crude to Gulf Coast \nrefineries, STB obligated itself to go further and study \n\n44 \nenvironmental effects on Gulf Coast communities and \nthe \nrefineries \ncontribution \nto \nclimate \nchange.  \nPet.App.34a-35a. \nThat approach gets matters almost exactly \nbackwards and defies this Court\u2019s direction to apply a \n\u201cpractical rule of reason\u201d to agency determinations \nand go no further in studying increasingly remote \nenvironmental effects.  Once an EIS analyzes a \nproject\u2019s proximate environmental effects, there is no \nvalid basis for a court to demand more.  The agency \ncan choose to go further, if time and resources allow.  \nBut the agency should not be faulted, let alone \nreversed, for going beyond what is legally required.  \nAnd if the agency concludes that investing additional \nbandwidth into studying a distant or speculative \nenvironmental effect is unlikely to be helpful, then a \ncourt has no \u201cmeaningful standard[]\u201d with which to \nsecond-guess the agency\u2019s judgment.  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 679-80 (2023).  \u201cTo require \notherwise would render agency decisionmaking \nintractable.\u201d  Marsh, 490 U.S. at 373. \nAn agency can deem further study unhelpful for \nany number of reasons.  As in Public Citizen, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when the \nagency lacks the legal \u201cability to prevent\u201d  the studied \neffect.  541 U.S. at 770.  Or, as in Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency might deem further study unhelpful when \nthe agency lacks subject-matter expertise to evaluate \nthe effect:  \u201cTime and resources are simply too \nlimited \u2026 to believe that Congress intended to\u201d \n\u201coblige[]\u201d agencies \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise that is not otherwise relevant \nto their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  460 U.S. \n\n45 \nat 776; see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n729 (2022) (\u201c\u2018When [an] agency has no comparative \nexpertise\u2019 in making certain policy judgments \u2026 \n\u2018Congress presumably would not\u2019 task it with doing \nso.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Kisor v. Wilkie, \n588 U.S. 558, 578 (2019))).  Or, as in Robertson, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when \nanother regulator has primary responsibility for \nremediating \nthe \nstudied \neffect \nin \na \nmore \ncomprehensive fashion.  See 490 U.S. at 340; p.24, \nsupra. \nThese sensible principles laid down by this Court \nexplain why STB was well within its prerogative to \ndecline further study of downline accidents, Gulf \nCoast communities, or \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at yet-\nto-be-built oil wells that may be constructed as a result \nof the new rail.  Pet.App.66a.  At the end of the day, \nSTB is not in a position to regulate rail traffic, track \nsafety, refinery practices, or climate change.  Cf. \nJames W. Coleman, Beyond the Pipeline Wars: \nReforming Environmental Assessment of Energy \nTransport Infrastructure, 2018 Utah L. Rev. 119, 143 \n(2018) (\u201cIn practice, in unpredictably changing energy \nmarkets, it is nearly impossible to predict the \nupstream and downstream impact of a new pipeline \nproject.\u201d).  More to the point, regulation of those issues \nshould focus on ensuring the optimal rules for all track \nsafety and all refinery emissions, not obsessing about \nthe marginal contributions of 88 miles of new track in \nremote, rural Utah.   \nTo be sure, NEPA calls for inter-agency \nconsultation.  But that consultation should be brought \n\n46 \nto bear only on the problems that the proponent \nagency is supposed to study under NEPA.  There is a \nvast difference between consulting with the Forest \nService to determine the effects of a proposed rail \nroute that passes through a National Forest, see, e.g., \nPet.App.182a, and asking EPA to assess how 88 miles \nof additional track in Utah will contribute to climate \nchange based on refining activities on the Gulf Coast.  \nNEPA may require the former, but the rule of reason \nprotects an agency that declines to do the latter. \nThe same logic applies for STB\u2019s reasonable \ndecision to study potential ecological harms from the \nrailway, \nbut \nnot \npotential \nharms \nfrom \nnew \nconstruction that the new line may precipitate.  The \nextent to which one infrastructure project will spur \nsubsequent development is hard enough to predict for \nexperts in real estate or urban planning\u2014and STB is \nneither of those things.  And that is doubly true given \nthat, as even the D.C. Circuit admitted, there is \npresently no way to know with any reasonable degree \nof certainty where exactly in the 12,000-square-mile \nUinta Basin this new development will end up or how \nextensive it will be (if it ends up being built at all).  See \nPet.App.31a-34a. \n \nTo \nthe \nextent \nsome \nnew \ndevelopment materializes, there will be time enough \nfor the appropriate state or federal agencies to perform \ntheir respective statutory mandates to evaluate the \nenvironmental effects of a concrete proposal.  There is \nno need to burden a different agency now with an \nentirely predictive and potentially unnecessary \nhypothetical EIS.   \nSo too for train accidents.  As noted, STB did look \ninto the risks of increased accidents downline, but it \n\n47 \nstopped its NEPA review of the potential risks of \nadditional accidents the new railway could pose after \nconcluding that the risks were de minimis.  See pp.12-\n13, supra.  That is an eminently reasonable approach.  \nRail traffic safety is not a purely (or even \npredominantly) environmental issue.  While train \naccidents, like tanker-truck accidents, have the \npotential to cause environmental problems, the \nprincipal regulatory goal is to minimize all accidents \non the rails, whether cars are full or empty, or whether \nthey carry passengers, wheat, or waxy crude.  And, \nmore to the point, there is a federal agency with \nexpertise, authority, and responsibility for rail safety, \nand it is not STB, but the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (\u201cFRA\u201d), whose Administrator must \nhave \u201cprofessional experience in railroad safety, \nhazardous materials safety, or other transportation \nsafety.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); see p.10, supra.  If \nrespondents think FRA is falling down in its \nmanagement of the national rail system, that is a \nproblem whether or not there are 88 miles of \nadditional track in rural Utah, and they should \nchallenge the relevant FRA agency action.  What they \nshould not be allowed to do is tie the Uinta Basin \nRailway up in court indefinitely by bringing a NEPA \nclaim against STB concerning a de minimis risk. \nThat is especially true given STB\u2019s role in \nadministering a statute that puts a thumb on the scale \nin favor of rail construction.  STB is the successor \nagency to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Its \nmembers must have expertise in transportation and \nbusiness, not oil refining, ecology, or even train safety.  \nIts fundamental duty under 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901 is \n\u201cauthoriz[ing]\u201d rail line \u201cactivities \u2026 []consistent with \n\n48 \nthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d  Id. \u00a710901(c).  \nNeedless to say, any project that contributes to \ninterstate commerce could also be said to contribute to \nclimate change or increased traffic on the national \nrailway system.  While agencies can certainly study \nthe \nenvironmental \nrisks \nfrom \nsuch \nincreased \ncommercial activity, the rule of reason places \nreasonable limits on how much study is necessary and \nprevents NEPA from working at cross-purposes with \nthe basic pro-development mission of agencies like \nSTB. \nAs the decision below illustrates, however, the \nD.C. Circuit has replaced this Court\u2019s rule of reason \nwith a mandate to consider everything under the Sun.  \nIf an agency can block a project on the ground that it \n\u201cwould be too harmful to the environment,\u201d then (says \nthe D.C. Circuit) the agency must consider any and all \ndistant environmental effects the project may (or may \nnot) engender\u2014even if the agency has no role in \nregulating those effects, or the conditions that may \nmitigate or exacerbate them.  Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at \n1373.  So, here, the fact that STB can \u201cdeny\u201d the \npermit required for the rail project \u201con the ground that \nthe railway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other \ncosts outweigh its expected benefits\u201d meant that it \nmust consider \u201cthe climate effects of the combustion of \nthe fuel intended to be extracted\u201d\u2014even though STB \nhas zero authority to do anything about oil extraction, \nfuel combustion, or climate effects.  Pet.App.36a-37a, \n66a.  That is not a rule of reason; it is the opposite. \nThis Court long ago cautioned that NEPA \u201cshould \nnot be\u201d turned into \u201ca game\u201d in which environmental \ngroups and other opponents of progress \u201cengage in \n\n49 \nunjustified obstructionism\u201d by raising a laundry list of \nfar-flung effects that, in their view, \u201c\u2018ought to be\u2019 \nconsidered,\u201d no matter how long it takes and no matter \nwhether the agency doing the considering has any \npower to do anything about the supposed problems the \nproject poses.  Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 553-54.  The \nCourt doubled down on that view in Metropolitan \nEdison, emphasizing that policy disagreements should \nbe aired in \u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA\u201d \nlitigation.  460 U.S. at 777.  It bears emphasis that \nNEPA applies equally to legislative proposals and \nagency projects, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and yet \nlegislative proposals do not come encumbered with \n3,600-page EISs.  The explanation for that difference \nlies in the felt-need of agencies to paper the record in \nthe context of projects that can be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Congress recently made its views on the \npotential misuses and excesses of NEPA crystal clear.  \nSee Part I.B., supra.  Yet, as the decision below makes \nall too clear, the home court of appeals for most of the \nfederal alphabet soup agencies has not gotten the \nmessage.  This Court should set the record straight, \nreverse the decision below, and unshackle agencies \nand infrastructure-development projects from NEPA-\nlitigation purgatory. \nIII. The Court Should Confirm That STB\u2019s EIS \nSatisfies NEPA\u2019s Requirements. \nThis is hardly a case of an agency that \ngreenlighted \na \nproject \nheedless \nof \npotential \nenvironmental impacts.  The EIS here runs to 3,600 \npages.  It took years to prepare, and it reflects \nconsultation with sister agencies with expertise in \nparticular areas.  But all that was not remotely good \n\n50 \nenough for the D.C. Circuit, which demanded more \nspeculation and more exhaustive consideration of \nenvironmental (and non-environmental) risks that are \nremote in both time and geography and that implicate \nissues far outside STB\u2019s narrowly focused mandate.  \nSuch an approach threatens a project that promises to \nbring significant economic development to the Uinta \nBasin by connecting that remote area with the \nnational economy.   \nAnd the threat does not end there.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment demands investment, and investors \ndemand a degree of certainty and assurance that they \nwill not become victims of a regulatory rope-a-dope.  \nOpponents of development know full well that they do \nnot need to win every legal battle to prevail in the war \nof attrition.  The decision below is thus a threat not \njust \nto \nthe \npromising \nproject \nhere, \nbut \nto \ninfrastructure development in general. \nThe best way for this Court to send a clear signal \nthat such NEPA abuse will not be tolerated is to \naffirmatively hold that STB\u2019s EIS here passes NEPA \nmuster.  As the preceding discussion reveals, STB\u2019s \nEIS was comprehensive and thoroughgoing.  It readily \ncleared NEPA\u2019s minimum requirements, since it \nstudied all effects on the physical environment \nproximately caused by approving the railroad.  It even \nwent past proximate cause and discussed some remote \neffects and marginal risks like train accidents and \ndown-rail fires.  But that was gravy, not grounds for \nvacatur and additional study.  Although the court of \nappeals may have preferred that discussion to be more \nthorough, that is not the test.  There is no basis for \nreversing a favorable NEPA determination that \n\n51 \nconsiders all of the proximate environmental effects of \nthe proposed project, and the rule of reason protects \nagencies when they go further and consider some \nmarginal risks without exhaustively examining them \nor running down every rabbit hole.  Simply put, absent \na failure to consider an effect that is both proximate \nand environmental, 3,600 pages of EIS ought to be \nmore than enough. \nIn these circumstances, remanding the EIS to the \nagency \nwould \naccomplish \nnothing \nbut \nsowing \nadditional confusion and delay.  To give both \npetitioners and the people of the Uinta Basin the \ncertainty that they deserve, the Court should reverse \nwith language making clear that STB has no \nobligation to revisit its EIS on remand. \n\n52 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJAY C.

My current understanding is likely based on the petition and the facts, which are heavily shaped by the petitioner's perspective. The respondent's brief will provide the direct counterarguments, their interpretation of precedent (like Public Citizen), and their reasoning for why the D.C. Circuit's broader view of NEPA's scope is correct. Accessing this information is absolutely critical to analyzing the full legal landscape and predicting how the justices will weigh the competing arguments. The task EIG is therefore very high, as a prediction without this information would be incomplete and unreliable. The design EIG is moderate; while reading the respondent's brief is a fundamental step in any case analysis, successfully executing this step and integrating its contents reinforces the importance of a balanced, primary-source-driven methodology, which is a key aspect of a robust prediction strategy.",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

The State \nhas significant interest in economic development op-\nportunities for its more rural counties. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project (Railway or Project) offers just \nsuch an opportunity. Utah state and federal officials \nstrongly support this Project for a variety of reasons, \nfrom economic to environmental to safety.  \nPetitioners give the legal reasons why the \nCourt should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision. The \nState agrees. But in Utah, this case affects far more \nthan clarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. \nThe Railway will help thousands of Utah residents, \nvarious local governments, and the State itself. So \nUtah submits this amicus brief to highlight how im-\nportant the Railway is to, and the positive impacts it \nwould have on, the affected counties, the State, and its \nresidents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See CA JA1304-05. That\u2019s \nbecause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nBasin are two-lane roads that present freight trans-\nportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-County \nInfrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has champi-\noned the Railway: an over 80-mile rail line that would \nconnect the Basin with the national rail network and \nunlock the region\u2019s economic potential. See, e.g., \nJA106. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state and federal level \nhave voiced their support for the Project. See, e.g., CA \nJA245, CA JA540-41, CA JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \n\n2 \napproval of the Railway. The STB had considered the \nProject\u2019s transportation merits, conducted a thorough \nand reasoned review under the National Environmen-\ntal Policy Act of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects falling within the STB\u2019s pur-\nview per Department of Transportation v. Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public \ncomments, \nand \nimposed \nextensive \nmitigation \nmeasures to reduce the Project\u2019s environmental im-\npact. See generally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at \n108a (discussing Public Citizen). The STB found that \nthe Project advanced important transportation bene-\nfits that outweighed mitigated environmental im-\npacts. Pet. App. 122a. The STB therefore exercised its \ndiscretion under the Interstate Commerce Commis-\nsion Termination Act\u2014which promotes railway devel-\nopment for the public good\u2014and approved the Project. \nId.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 (stating federal policy in reg-\nulating railroad industry).   \nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit took a different \nview of NEPA\u2019s scope. The circuit court determined, in \npart, that the STB\u2019s analysis was inadequate because \nit did not weigh speculative environmental impacts \nthe Railway might cause upstream or downline in \nother parts of the country and over which the STB had \nno regulatory authority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, \n66a-68a, 70a. The court said the STB\u2019s position \u201cthat \nit need not consider [environmental] effects it cannot \nprevent is simply inapplicable\u201d because the STB can \nweigh whether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental \nand other costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at \n37a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s take on NEPA\u2019s require-\nments is wrong. Pet. Br. at 19-49; Fed. Resp. Br. at 39-\n45. This Court should reverse. But even beyond the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the \n\n3 \nmany benefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uin-\ntah Basin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to \nexplain why this Project matters to the State and its \nresidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Railway \nfrom the beginning because it will promote the devel-\nopment of local and statewide economies and improve \nthe lives of Utahns. See, e.g., CA JA245. The Railway \nwill provide critical infrastructure facilitating the flow \nof commodities to and from the Uintah Basin. It has \nthe potential to open the region to entirely new mar-\nkets that rely on freight shipping and to create jobs. \nAnd it will do so while protecting the environment and \nUtah\u2019s transportation workers. Blocking the Project \nstifles economic, environmental, and safety improve-\nments in the region and hurts area residents. The \nState of Utah urges this Court to view the Railway as \na vital investment in critical infrastructure that will \nbenefit the Uintah Basin, the State of Utah, its resi-\ndents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like the Uinta Basin \nRailway realize the policies that promote the im-\nportance and development of the rural American econ-\nomy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe STB concluded that the Project would pro-\nvide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe STB must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the STB was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).1  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)2; see \nalso CA JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in \nthe region, significant investment will be needed, in-\ncluding investments in strategic infrastructure. As \nthe STB recognized, the Railway has the potential to \nadvance many rail policy objectives by addressing \n \n1https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nthese problems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway \nlikely \u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job \ncreation by allowing energy, agricultural, mining \nproducts, and manufactured goods, to reach global \nmarkets more easily.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely \non shipping by freight will be able to open locations in \nthe previously inaccessible region, which has the po-\ntential to open new markets and create jobs. See 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide substan-\ntial economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which also supported \nthe project. JA546-47 (Ute Tribe noting that \u201c[o]il and \ngas production on the reservation is the most signifi-\ncant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d and \nurging the STB to \u201cmove swiftly with final approval \nand issuance of license\u201d). This Railway promises to \nbring tremendous economic opportunities to the peo-\nple of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties. All \nthree counties have been vocal proponents of the Rail-\nway. CA JA582 (\u201cCarbon County believes that the \nUinta Basin Railway project will fill a gap in major \ninfrastructure that will help develop and diversify the \nregional economy.\u201d); CA JA579 (\u201cThe Duchesne \nCounty Commission believes that the Uinta Basin \nRailway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); CA JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The STB\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. The D.C. Circuit did not. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nCA JA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends \non trucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nCA JA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, \nthis Railway offers to break that dependence, which \nhas \u201champered the economic vitality of the area and \npresents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely on \nrail access will be able, for the first time, to consider \nlocations in the Uintah Basin. CA JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would significantly decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the Uintah Basin\u2019s in-\ndustry. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., The Positive Env\u2019t Effects of \nIncreased Freight by Rail Movements in America at 3 \n(June 2020) (\u201cIf 25% of the truck traffic moving at \n\n7 \nleast 750 miles went by rail instead, annual fuel sav-\nings would be some 1.2 billion gallons and annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions would fall by approximately \n13.1 million tons,\u201d and \u201c[i]f 50% of the truck traffic \nmoving at least 750 miles went by rail instead, annual \nfuel savings would be approximately 2.3 billion gal-\nlons and greenhouse gas emissions would fall by ap-\nproximately 26.2 million tons.\u201d).3 Freight rail\u2019s fuel ef-\nficiency in the United States has been increasing for \nnearly four decades straight. Id. at 4 (\u201cU.S. freight rail \nvolume is higher than it used to be, but railroad fuel \nconsumption is much lower. In 2019 alone, U.S. \nfreight railroads consumed 656 million fewer gallons \nof fuel and emitted 7.3 million fewer tons of carbon di-\noxide than they would have if their fuel efficiency had \nremained constant since 2000.\u201d). Today, rail is the \nmost fuel-efficient way to move freight over land. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail & Climate Change (up-\ndated Feb. 2024).4 As a result, \u201cmoving freight by rail \ninstead of truck lowers greenhouse gas emissions by \nup to 75%, on average[.]\u201d Positive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, \nat 1.  \nShipping freight by rail instead of by truck is \nnot only better for the environment, it\u2019s safer for in-\ndustry employees and Utah drivers. Because a single \ntrain carries the freight of hundreds of trucks, moving \nfreight by rail instead of by truck takes trucks off the \nroads, easing congestion for individual drivers. Posi-\ntive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, at 3. Railways are also safer \n \n3https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AAR-Posi-\ntive-Environmental-Effects-of-Freight-Rail-White-Paper-\n62020.pdf. \n4https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AAR-\nFreight-Rail-Climate-Change-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n8 \nfor employees\u2014the employee injury rate in trucking \nand many other industries is higher than that in rail. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail Emp. Safety at 1 (up-\ndated Mar. 2024).5 And the employee injury rate in \nrail has been trending downward to an all-time low in \n2023. Id.  \n \nIII. \nFederal overregulation ignores States\u2019 in-\nterests and stunts development. \nThe STB recognized a fundamental point that \nthe D.C. Circuit did not. \u201cOil and gas development \n[was] not part of\u201d the proposed agency action\u2014railway \napproval\u2014before the STB and would be \u201csubject to the \napproval processes of other federal, state, local, and \ntribal agencies.\u201d JA 522. By pushing NEPA review \nwell past its legal and logical limits, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \ndecision seemingly presumes that only the federal \ngovernment and its myriad agencies care about the \nenvironment. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAnd this paternalistic view ignores Utah\u2019s sovereign \ninterests and needlessly stymies development.  \nFirst, Utah\u2019s interest in economic development \nin no way negates the State\u2019s ongoing environmental \ninterests. Utah\u2019s leaders and residents have a vested \ninterest in a healthy environment: they live here, \nwork here, recreate here, raise families here, and in-\nvite the world to come share the State\u2019s world-class \nscenery, skiing, hiking, fishing, rock-climbing, moun-\ntain-biking, and state and national parks, among \nmany other outdoor activities. No one\u2014including fed-\neral bureaucrats located far away in Washington, \n \n5https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AAR-Rail-\nroad-Workplace-Safety-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n9 \nD.C.\u2014has more interest in Utah\u2019 environment than \nUtahns.  \nThat\u2019s why Utah regulates oil and gas activity \nin the State, including: drilling; well completion, oper-\nation, and maintenance; construction; recovery tech-\nniques; and remediation activities. Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 40-\n6-2.5(1), -5(3)(a). To that end, the Utah Board of Oil, \nGas, and Mining has promulgated comprehensive reg-\nulations governing well locations, well permitting, \npre-drill evaluations, drilling operations, well control, \nwell testing and inspections, fire hazards, and pollu-\ntion and surface damage control. See, e.g., Utah Ad-\nmin. Code R649-3-1 to -19. Operators must reasonably \nguard against\u2014including taking specified minimum \nsteps to prevent\u2014polluting lands, streams, reservoirs, \nnatural drainage ways, and underground water ways. \nId. R649-3-15(1). They must also maintain the prop-\nerty with \u201cdue regard\u201d for its preservation and conser-\nvation and for \u201cthe health and safety of employees and \npeople residing in close proximity.\u201d Id. R649-3-15(1.1). \nAnd the wells remain subject to inspection to ensure \ncompliance with the regulations. Id. R649-3-17; see \nalso Utah Code \u00a7 40-6-16(1).    \nBeyond the oil and gas laws and rules, oil and \ngas operations are subject to Utah\u2019s Air Conservation \nAct, Utah Code \u00a7 19-2-101 to -304, which is meant to \nachieve and maintain air quality levels that \u201cprotect \nhuman health and safety\u201d and \u201cprevent injury to plant \nand animal life and property,\u201d id. \u00a7 19-2-101(2). Under \nthe Act\u2019s authority, the Utah Air Quality Board has \nenacted comprehensive regulations governing oil and \nnatural gas exploration, production, and transmis-\nsion, and well production facilities. Utah Admin. Code \nR307-501-3; see also id. R307-501 to R307-511 (regu-\nlations governing pneumatic controllers, flares, tank \ntruck loading, registration requirements, storage \n\n10 \nvessels, dehydrators, VOC control devices, leak detec-\ntion and repair, natural gas engine requirements, and \nassociated gas flares).  \nSimilarly, oil and gas operators (like any other \nUtah industry) must abide by Utah\u2019s Water Quality \nAct, which prohibits (1) discharging pollutants into \nstate waters; (2) causing pollution \u201cwhich constitutes \na menace to public health and welfare, or is harmful \nto wildlife, fish, or aquatic life, or impairs domestic, \nagricultural, industrial, recreational, or other benefi-\ncial uses of water\u201d; or (3) placing \u201cwaste in a location \nwhere there is probable cause to believe it will cause \npollution.\u201d Utah Code \u00a7 19-5-107(1)(a). \nGiven Utah\u2019s (and other States\u2019) own environ-\nmental regulations, based on their own sovereign in-\nterests and knowledge of their own State\u2019s needs and \ncircumstances, there\u2019s simply no justification for the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s overextension of NEPA review. The STB \nalready produced an exhaustive 3,600-page environ-\nmental impact statement under NEPA\u2014all for a rela-\ntively short 80-plus mile proposed railway in a rural \nand remote part of Utah. Pet. Br. at 11. That more \nthan satisfies NEPA\u2019s goal to ensure agencies make \nenvironmentally informed decisions. Id. at 4. Requir-\ning even more analysis of speculative impacts in other \nparts of the country ignores and intrudes on each \nState\u2019s sovereign interests in their own environmental \nregulations.  \nSecond, federal overregulation delays, if not \nkills, much-needed development. A recent news arti-\ncle highlighted just a few of the problems various \ntypes of projects face in dealing with federal regula-\ntors. Amy Joi O\u2019Donoghue, What\u2019s up with delays on \nprojects on federal lands? Deseret.com (May 27, \n\n11 \n2024).6 Everyone recognizes the benefits from and \nneed for diverse energy sources. But \u201c[d]espite being a \ncarbon free and abundant source of energy in Utah, \ntapping geothermal resources working through the \nBureau of Land Management is likened by some in the \nindustry as a nagging, painful canker sore that pre-\nsents no cure.\u201d Id. One company nominated BLM con-\ntrolled land for geothermal exploration in 2008 and \ncompleted an environmental assessment more than \nseven years ago, but still can\u2019t move forward. Id. \nOther companies nominated BLM land for geothermal \nexploration, spent years on technical due diligence, in-\ncluding time and capital, and had planned on more \ncapital expenditures, only to have BLM abruptly an-\nnounce that it was deferring leasing the land until late \n2025. Id. The federal delays and inconsistencies in \nUtah push geothermal developers to other states. Id.  \nOil and gas producers are also finding it diffi-\ncult to lease land from federal regulators. One indus-\ntry representative explained that \u201cYou can be held up \nfor years waiting for a lease to come up and then let\u2019s \nsay if it does, if it is litigated\u2014which almost all of \nthem have been since 2016\u2014then you can have the \nBLM saying well, we\u2019re uncertain what this litigation \nis going to look like so we\u2019re just going to hold up your \napplication to drill permit.\u201d Id.    \nThe TransWest Express high-voltage transmis-\nsion line, crossing parts of four states including Utah, \nlikewise faced inexplicable delay. It took nine years to \nget right-of-way approvals, then another five years to \ncomplete right-of-way requirements to move forward \nwith construction. Id.    \n \n6https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/05/27/whats-up-with-\ndelays-on-projects-on-federal-lands/. \n\n12 \nAnd it remains uncertain whether a long \nplanned four-mile, four-lane highway will be built in \nsouthern Utah. Federal agencies granted approval to \nproceed in 2021. But conservation groups sued over \nthe project and, as part of a settlement in that suit, \nthe federal agencies announced they would revisit the \nhighway\u2019s approval and conduct a new review. Id. All \nthis has left state and federal leaders wondering what \ntransportation needs can be realistically satisfied un-\nder current federal regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine \nwe [can] do the things that we need to do to support \nour economy, our society,\u201d the director of Utah\u2019s De-\npartment of Transportation said. \u201cToday, it seems like \nit\u2019s much harder to do things that matter.\u201d Id. \nFederal regulations don\u2019t need to be applied \nthis way. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s overbroad application of \nNEPA only exacerbates the federal overregulation \nproblem.   \n \nConclusion \nThe Court should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \njudgment below.  \n \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n /s/ Stanford E. Purser  \n \nStanford E.

Rep. to the Governor \n(2021) ....................................................................... 4 \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \nInterest of Amicus Curiae \nAmicus Curiae is the State of Utah. The State \nhas significant interest in economic development op-\nportunities for its more rural counties. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project (Railway or Project) offers just \nsuch an opportunity. Utah state and federal officials \nstrongly support this Project for a variety of reasons, \nfrom economic to environmental to safety.  \nPetitioners give the legal reasons why the \nCourt should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision. The \nState agrees. But in Utah, this case affects far more \nthan clarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. \nThe Railway will help thousands of Utah residents, \nvarious local governments, and the State itself. So \nUtah submits this amicus brief to highlight how im-\nportant the Railway is to, and the positive impacts it \nwould have on, the affected counties, the State, and its \nresidents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See CA JA1304-05. That\u2019s \nbecause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nBasin are two-lane roads that present freight trans-\nportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-County \nInfrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has champi-\noned the Railway: an over 80-mile rail line that would \nconnect the Basin with the national rail network and \nunlock the region\u2019s economic potential. See, e.g., \nJA106. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state and federal level \nhave voiced their support for the Project. See, e.g., CA \nJA245, CA JA540-41, CA JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \n\n2 \napproval of the Railway. The STB had considered the \nProject\u2019s transportation merits, conducted a thorough \nand reasoned review under the National Environmen-\ntal Policy Act of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects falling within the STB\u2019s pur-\nview per Department of Transportation v. Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public \ncomments, \nand \nimposed \nextensive \nmitigation \nmeasures to reduce the Project\u2019s environmental im-\npact. See generally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at \n108a (discussing Public Citizen). The STB found that \nthe Project advanced important transportation bene-\nfits that outweighed mitigated environmental im-\npacts. Pet. App. 122a. The STB therefore exercised its \ndiscretion under the Interstate Commerce Commis-\nsion Termination Act\u2014which promotes railway devel-\nopment for the public good\u2014and approved the Project. \nId.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 (stating federal policy in reg-\nulating railroad industry).   \nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit took a different \nview of NEPA\u2019s scope. The circuit court determined, in \npart, that the STB\u2019s analysis was inadequate because \nit did not weigh speculative environmental impacts \nthe Railway might cause upstream or downline in \nother parts of the country and over which the STB had \nno regulatory authority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, \n66a-68a, 70a. The court said the STB\u2019s position \u201cthat \nit need not consider [environmental] effects it cannot \nprevent is simply inapplicable\u201d because the STB can \nweigh whether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental \nand other costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at \n37a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s take on NEPA\u2019s require-\nments is wrong. Pet. Br. at 19-49; Fed. Resp. Br. at 39-\n45. This Court should reverse. But even beyond the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the \n\n3 \nmany benefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uin-\ntah Basin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to \nexplain why this Project matters to the State and its \nresidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Railway \nfrom the beginning because it will promote the devel-\nopment of local and statewide economies and improve \nthe lives of Utahns. See, e.g., CA JA245. The Railway \nwill provide critical infrastructure facilitating the flow \nof commodities to and from the Uintah Basin. It has \nthe potential to open the region to entirely new mar-\nkets that rely on freight shipping and to create jobs. \nAnd it will do so while protecting the environment and \nUtah\u2019s transportation workers. Blocking the Project \nstifles economic, environmental, and safety improve-\nments in the region and hurts area residents. The \nState of Utah urges this Court to view the Railway as \na vital investment in critical infrastructure that will \nbenefit the Uintah Basin, the State of Utah, its resi-\ndents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like the Uinta Basin \nRailway realize the policies that promote the im-\nportance and development of the rural American econ-\nomy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe STB concluded that the Project would pro-\nvide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe STB must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the STB was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).1  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)2; see \nalso CA JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in \nthe region, significant investment will be needed, in-\ncluding investments in strategic infrastructure. As \nthe STB recognized, the Railway has the potential to \nadvance many rail policy objectives by addressing \n \n1https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nthese problems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway \nlikely \u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job \ncreation by allowing energy, agricultural, mining \nproducts, and manufactured goods, to reach global \nmarkets more easily.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely \non shipping by freight will be able to open locations in \nthe previously inaccessible region, which has the po-\ntential to open new markets and create jobs. See 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide substan-\ntial economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which also supported \nthe project. JA546-47 (Ute Tribe noting that \u201c[o]il and \ngas production on the reservation is the most signifi-\ncant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d and \nurging the STB to \u201cmove swiftly with final approval \nand issuance of license\u201d). This Railway promises to \nbring tremendous economic opportunities to the peo-\nple of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties. All \nthree counties have been vocal proponents of the Rail-\nway. CA JA582 (\u201cCarbon County believes that the \nUinta Basin Railway project will fill a gap in major \ninfrastructure that will help develop and diversify the \nregional economy.\u201d); CA JA579 (\u201cThe Duchesne \nCounty Commission believes that the Uinta Basin \nRailway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); CA JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The STB\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. The D.C. Circuit did not. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nCA JA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends \non trucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nCA JA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, \nthis Railway offers to break that dependence, which \nhas \u201champered the economic vitality of the area and \npresents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely on \nrail access will be able, for the first time, to consider \nlocations in the Uintah Basin. CA JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would significantly decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the Uintah Basin\u2019s in-\ndustry. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., The Positive Env\u2019t Effects of \nIncreased Freight by Rail Movements in America at 3 \n(June 2020) (\u201cIf 25% of the truck traffic moving at \n\n7 \nleast 750 miles went by rail instead, annual fuel sav-\nings would be some 1.2 billion gallons and annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions would fall by approximately \n13.1 million tons,\u201d and \u201c[i]f 50% of the truck traffic \nmoving at least 750 miles went by rail instead, annual \nfuel savings would be approximately 2.3 billion gal-\nlons and greenhouse gas emissions would fall by ap-\nproximately 26.2 million tons.\u201d).3 Freight rail\u2019s fuel ef-\nficiency in the United States has been increasing for \nnearly four decades straight. Id. at 4 (\u201cU.S. freight rail \nvolume is higher than it used to be, but railroad fuel \nconsumption is much lower. In 2019 alone, U.S. \nfreight railroads consumed 656 million fewer gallons \nof fuel and emitted 7.3 million fewer tons of carbon di-\noxide than they would have if their fuel efficiency had \nremained constant since 2000.\u201d). Today, rail is the \nmost fuel-efficient way to move freight over land. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail & Climate Change (up-\ndated Feb. 2024).4 As a result, \u201cmoving freight by rail \ninstead of truck lowers greenhouse gas emissions by \nup to 75%, on average[.]\u201d Positive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, \nat 1.  \nShipping freight by rail instead of by truck is \nnot only better for the environment, it\u2019s safer for in-\ndustry employees and Utah drivers. Because a single \ntrain carries the freight of hundreds of trucks, moving \nfreight by rail instead of by truck takes trucks off the \nroads, easing congestion for individual drivers. Posi-\ntive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, at 3. Railways are also safer \n \n3https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AAR-Posi-\ntive-Environmental-Effects-of-Freight-Rail-White-Paper-\n62020.pdf. \n4https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AAR-\nFreight-Rail-Climate-Change-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n8 \nfor employees\u2014the employee injury rate in trucking \nand many other industries is higher than that in rail. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail Emp. Safety at 1 (up-\ndated Mar. 2024).5 And the employee injury rate in \nrail has been trending downward to an all-time low in \n2023. Id.  \n \nIII. \nFederal overregulation ignores States\u2019 in-\nterests and stunts development. \nThe STB recognized a fundamental point that \nthe D.C. Circuit did not. \u201cOil and gas development \n[was] not part of\u201d the proposed agency action\u2014railway \napproval\u2014before the STB and would be \u201csubject to the \napproval processes of other federal, state, local, and \ntribal agencies.\u201d JA 522. By pushing NEPA review \nwell past its legal and logical limits, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \ndecision seemingly presumes that only the federal \ngovernment and its myriad agencies care about the \nenvironment. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAnd this paternalistic view ignores Utah\u2019s sovereign \ninterests and needlessly stymies development.  \nFirst, Utah\u2019s interest in economic development \nin no way negates the State\u2019s ongoing environmental \ninterests. Utah\u2019s leaders and residents have a vested \ninterest in a healthy environment: they live here, \nwork here, recreate here, raise families here, and in-\nvite the world to come share the State\u2019s world-class \nscenery, skiing, hiking, fishing, rock-climbing, moun-\ntain-biking, and state and national parks, among \nmany other outdoor activities. No one\u2014including fed-\neral bureaucrats located far away in Washington, \n \n5https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AAR-Rail-\nroad-Workplace-Safety-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n9 \nD.C.\u2014has more interest in Utah\u2019 environment than \nUtahns.  \nThat\u2019s why Utah regulates oil and gas activity \nin the State, including: drilling; well completion, oper-\nation, and maintenance; construction; recovery tech-\nniques; and remediation activities. Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 40-\n6-2.5(1), -5(3)(a). To that end, the Utah Board of Oil, \nGas, and Mining has promulgated comprehensive reg-\nulations governing well locations, well permitting, \npre-drill evaluations, drilling operations, well control, \nwell testing and inspections, fire hazards, and pollu-\ntion and surface damage control. See, e.g., Utah Ad-\nmin. Code R649-3-1 to -19. Operators must reasonably \nguard against\u2014including taking specified minimum \nsteps to prevent\u2014polluting lands, streams, reservoirs, \nnatural drainage ways, and underground water ways. \nId.

They must also maintain the prop-\nerty with \u201cdue regard\u201d for its preservation and conser-\nvation and for \u201cthe health and safety of employees and \npeople residing in close proximity.\u201d Id. R649-3-15(1.1). \nAnd the wells remain subject to inspection to ensure \ncompliance with the regulations. Id. R649-3-17; see \nalso Utah Code \u00a7 40-6-16(1).    \nBeyond the oil and gas laws and rules, oil and \ngas operations are subject to Utah\u2019s Air Conservation \nAct, Utah Code \u00a7 19-2-101 to -304, which is meant to \nachieve and maintain air quality levels that \u201cprotect \nhuman health and safety\u201d and \u201cprevent injury to plant \nand animal life and property,\u201d id. \u00a7 19-2-101(2). Under \nthe Act\u2019s authority, the Utah Air Quality Board has \nenacted comprehensive regulations governing oil and \nnatural gas exploration, production, and transmis-\nsion, and well production facilities. Utah Admin. Code \nR307-501-3; see also id. R307-501 to R307-511 (regu-\nlations governing pneumatic controllers, flares, tank \ntruck loading, registration requirements, storage \n\n10 \nvessels, dehydrators, VOC control devices, leak detec-\ntion and repair, natural gas engine requirements, and \nassociated gas flares).  \nSimilarly, oil and gas operators (like any other \nUtah industry) must abide by Utah\u2019s Water Quality \nAct, which prohibits (1) discharging pollutants into \nstate waters; (2) causing pollution \u201cwhich constitutes \na menace to public health and welfare, or is harmful \nto wildlife, fish, or aquatic life, or impairs domestic, \nagricultural, industrial, recreational, or other benefi-\ncial uses of water\u201d; or (3) placing \u201cwaste in a location \nwhere there is probable cause to believe it will cause \npollution.\u201d Utah Code \u00a7 19-5-107(1)(a). \nGiven Utah\u2019s (and other States\u2019) own environ-\nmental regulations, based on their own sovereign in-\nterests and knowledge of their own State\u2019s needs and \ncircumstances, there\u2019s simply no justification for the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s overextension of NEPA review. The STB \nalready produced an exhaustive 3,600-page environ-\nmental impact statement under NEPA\u2014all for a rela-\ntively short 80-plus mile proposed railway in a rural \nand remote part of Utah. Pet. Br. at 11. That more \nthan satisfies NEPA\u2019s goal to ensure agencies make \nenvironmentally informed decisions. Id. at 4. Requir-\ning even more analysis of speculative impacts in other \nparts of the country ignores and intrudes on each \nState\u2019s sovereign interests in their own environmental \nregulations.  \nSecond, federal overregulation delays, if not \nkills, much-needed development. A recent news arti-\ncle highlighted just a few of the problems various \ntypes of projects face in dealing with federal regula-\ntors. Amy Joi O\u2019Donoghue, What\u2019s up with delays on \nprojects on federal lands? Deseret.com (May 27, \n\n11 \n2024).6 Everyone recognizes the benefits from and \nneed for diverse energy sources. But \u201c[d]espite being a \ncarbon free and abundant source of energy in Utah, \ntapping geothermal resources working through the \nBureau of Land Management is likened by some in the \nindustry as a nagging, painful canker sore that pre-\nsents no cure.\u201d Id. One company nominated BLM con-\ntrolled land for geothermal exploration in 2008 and \ncompleted an environmental assessment more than \nseven years ago, but still can\u2019t move forward. Id. \nOther companies nominated BLM land for geothermal \nexploration, spent years on technical due diligence, in-\ncluding time and capital, and had planned on more \ncapital expenditures, only to have BLM abruptly an-\nnounce that it was deferring leasing the land until late \n2025. Id. The federal delays and inconsistencies in \nUtah push geothermal developers to other states. Id.  \nOil and gas producers are also finding it diffi-\ncult to lease land from federal regulators. One indus-\ntry representative explained that \u201cYou can be held up \nfor years waiting for a lease to come up and then let\u2019s \nsay if it does, if it is litigated\u2014which almost all of \nthem have been since 2016\u2014then you can have the \nBLM saying well, we\u2019re uncertain what this litigation \nis going to look like so we\u2019re just going to hold up your \napplication to drill permit.\u201d Id.    \nThe TransWest Express high-voltage transmis-\nsion line, crossing parts of four states including Utah, \nlikewise faced inexplicable delay. It took nine years to \nget right-of-way approvals, then another five years to \ncomplete right-of-way requirements to move forward \nwith construction. Id.    \n \n6https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/05/27/whats-up-with-\ndelays-on-projects-on-federal-lands/. \n\n12 \nAnd it remains uncertain whether a long \nplanned four-mile, four-lane highway will be built in \nsouthern Utah. Federal agencies granted approval to \nproceed in 2021. But conservation groups sued over \nthe project and, as part of a settlement in that suit, \nthe federal agencies announced they would revisit the \nhighway\u2019s approval and conduct a new review. Id. All \nthis has left state and federal leaders wondering what \ntransportation needs can be realistically satisfied un-\nder current federal regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine \nwe [can] do the things that we need to do to support \nour economy, our society,\u201d the director of Utah\u2019s De-\npartment of Transportation said. \u201cToday, it seems like \nit\u2019s much harder to do things that matter.\u201d Id. \nFederal regulations don\u2019t need to be applied \nthis way. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s overbroad application of \nNEPA only exacerbates the federal overregulation \nproblem.   \n \nConclusion \nThe Court should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \njudgment below.  \n \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n /s/ Stanford E. Purser  \n \nStanford E.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.

Admin., \nAbout FRA, https://railroads.dot.gov/about-\nfra/about-fra (last visited Aug. 28, 2024) .............. 10 \n  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \nplays an important role in ensuring that agency \nactions account for \u201cecological systems and natural \nresources important to\u201d the United States.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a74321.  But NEPA was designed to ensure that \nagencies did not proceed heedless of environmental \nconsequences, not to require exhaustive consideration \nof remote contingencies or tie infrastructure projects \nin endless red tape.  If a new rail line in Utah will \ndisplace habitat for bighorn sheep or alter the \ntopography in ways that threaten a pristine mountain \nstream, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) \nmust \nconsider \nthose \nissues. \n \nIn \ncontrast, \nimponderables such as whether the new rail might \ncontribute to an accident hundreds or thousands of \nmiles downline or somehow affect \u201cenvironmental \njustice [in] communities [on] the Gulf Coast,\u201d \nPet.App.70a, are not issues STB must run to ground.  \nAccording to the D.C. Circuit, however, STB needed to \ndo that\u2014and more.  The decision below saddles STB \nwith endless make-work far outside its wheelhouse, \nrequiring the agency to evaluate remote effects \nranging from potential upstream economic activity to \npotential downstream \u201ceffects of increased crude oil \nrefining on Gulf Coast communities in Louisiana and \nTexas.\u201d  Pet.App.12a.  That boil-the-ocean approach \nhas no basis in statutory text or this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and it fares even worse as a matter of \ncommon sense.  It makes no sense to force an agency \nwith a pro-construction mandate to put development \nprojects on hold pending an exhaustive analysis of \nuncertain and far-downstream ramifications directly \nin another agency\u2019s lane. \n\n2 \nCongress recently reinforced that reality by \nenacting the BUILDER Act\u2014short for \u201cBuilding \nUnited States Infrastructure through Limited Delays \nand Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014clarifying that NEPA only \nrequires agencies to consider \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of [a] proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i) (2023) (emphasis added).  As \nreflected in that statutory title, Congress effectively \ncodified what this Court has long held:  An agency\u2019s \nNEPA analysis need only consider environmental \neffects with \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d to \nthe agency action, and can safely ignore far-\ndownstream potentialities in another agency\u2019s lane.  \nMetro. Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983).  When another agency more \ndirectly regulates small and uncertain effects of a \nproposed agency action, but the reviewing agency does \nnot regulate those things at all, it cannot be the case \nthat those potential effects have a reasonably close \n(i.e., proximate) relationship to the project.  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 (2004). \nIf respondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving a new 88-mile rail line in \nrural Utah proximately caused downline rail accidents \nthousands of miles away and air pollution on the Gulf \nCoast\u2014to say nothing of global increases in \natmospheric temperatures\u2014they would be laughed \nout of court (and not just because of sovereign \nimmunity).  The result should not change just because \nrespondents brought a NEPA claim.  The decision \nbelow converts NEPA from a sensible procedural \ncheck on agency actions into an anti-development \ntreadmill.  This Court should reverse. \n\n3 \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, 82 F.4th 1152, is \nreproduced at Pet.App.1a-71a, and its order denying \nrehearing, 2023 WL 8375640, is reproduced at \nPet.App.72a-73a.  STB\u2019s decision granting final \nproject approval, 2021 WL 5960905, is reproduced at \nPet.App.74a-189a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 18, \n2023, and denied rehearing on December 4, 2023.  \nPetitioners timely sought certiorari on March 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of NEPA and STB\u2019s \norganic statute, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, are \nreproduced in the accompanying statutory appendix. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background  \nCongress passed and President Nixon signed \nNEPA with the lofty aim of \u201cencourag[ing] productive \nand enjoyable harmony between man and his \nenvironment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 (emphasis added).  To \nbalance these \u201csweeping\u201d\u2014and often conflicting\u2014\n\u201cpolicy goals,\u201d Congress took a light touch.  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley City Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Rather than \u201cmandate particular results,\u201d \nCongress \u201csimply prescribe[d]\u201d \u201ca set of action-forcing \nprocedures that require agencies take a hard look at \nenvironmental consequences\u201d of proposed actions.  Id.  \nFor legislative proposals and \u201cother major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment,\u201d NEPA requires \u201call agencies of \n\n4 \nthe Federal Government\u201d to prepare \u201ca detailed\u201d \nenvironmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) describing, \ninter alia, \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction,\u201d any \u201cadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented,\u201d and any \u201calternatives to the proposed \naction.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii) (2019).  As long \nas an EIS \u201cadequately identifie[s] and evaluate[s]\u201d \n\u201cthe adverse environmental effects of the proposed \naction,\u201d \u201cthe agency is not constrained by NEPA from \ndeciding \nthat \nother \nvalues \noutweigh \nthe \nenvironmental costs.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In \nother words, \u201cNEPA merely prohibits uninformed\u2014\nrather than unwise\u2014agency action.\u201d  Id. at 351. \nBut what began as a modest procedural check to \nensure that agencies did not proceed heedless of \nproximate environmental impacts soon took on a life \nof its own, with \u201cenvironmental and industry groups\u201d \nseizing on NEPA compliance in litigation seemingly \naimed at \u201ctak[ing] financial resources away from \ndevelopers and creat[ing] such delay as to completely \nimpede the progress of a project.\u201d  Sarah Imhoff, Note, \nA Streamlined Approach to Renewable Energy \nDevelopment: Bringing the United States into a \nGreener Energy Future, 26 Geo. Int\u2019l Envtl. L. Rev. 69, \n91 (2013).  In one well-known example, \u201ca staggering \ncast of well-funded opponents\u201d leveraged NEPA and \nother \u201cenvironmental compliance laws to grind\u201d the \nCape Wind offshore wind farm project in Nantucket \nSound \u201cinto oblivion after a fight lasting over 16 years \nand costing the developers $100 million.\u201d  J.B. Ruhl & \nJames Salzman, What Happens When the Green New \nDeal Meets the Old Green Laws?, 44 Vt. L. Rev. 693, \n716 (2020).   \n\n5 \nOn multiple occasions, this Court intervened to \nrein in other egregious examples of agency excess.  In \nseveral early cases, the Court made clear that NEPA \ndoes not demand \u201ccontemplat[ing] the environmental \nimpact of an action as an abstract exercise,\u201d Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, \n100 (1983), and that agencies need not \u201cferret out\u201d \nevery possible consideration, Vt. Yankee v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 551 (1978).  A few years \nafter that, the Court unanimously held that an agency \nneed only study environmental effects proximately \ncaused by the proposed agency action, while \nemphasizing that \u201c[t]he political process, and not \nNEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air \npolicy disagreements.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 777.  \nThe Court reaffirmed that proximate-cause limit in \n2004, while also making clear that the scope of an \nagency\u2019s environmental review under NEPA is \ngoverned by a \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767.   \nBut in the Ninth Circuit and in the D.C. Circuit, \nthese interventions have gone unheeded.  Those two \ncourts take a distinctly (and unduly) capacious view of \nNEPA\u2019s scope, holding\u2014among other things\u2014that an \nagency \u201ccannot avoid its responsibility under NEPA to \nidentify and describe the environmental effects of\u201d \nagency action \u201con the ground that it lacks authority to \nprevent, \ncontrol, \nor \nmitigate \nthose\u201d \neffects.  \nPet.App.36a; see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC \n(\u201cSabal Trail\u201d), 867 F.3d 1357, 1373-75 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 \nF.3d 723, 736-40 (9th Cir. 2020); Pet.18-20.  Other \ncircuits take a decidedly more balanced view, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s emphasis that agencies \n\n6 \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.  See, e.g., Protect Our Parks v. \nButtigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 400 (7th Cir. 2022); Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 \nF.3d 1288, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2019); Kentuckians \nfor the Commonwealth v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, \n746 F.3d 698, 710 (6th Cir. 2014); N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t \nProt. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm\u2019n, 561 F.3d 132, 139 \n(3d Cir. 2009); Ohio Valley Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 196-97 (4th Cir. 2009); see Pet.14-17. \nFueled by the demands of the Ninth and D.C. \nCircuits, NEPA litigation has flooded in, swelling \nagency wait-times and project costs.  On average, \ncompleting an EIS takes an agency 4.5 years; 25% \ntake more than 6 years; some take more than 15 years.  \nCouncil on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of the Pres., \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010-\n2018), at 4 (2020).  The average length of a final EIS \nruns 661 pages; 25% stretch past 748 pages; some\u2014\nincluding the 3,600-page EIS here\u2014balloon to over \n2,000 pages.  Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office of \nthe Pres., Length of Environmental Impact Statements \n(2013-2018), at 5 (2020).   \nFearing the risk of being sued in the D.C. \nCircuit\u2014where most agencies are headquartered\u2014\n\u201c[a]gencies will seek to protect EISs from legal \nchallenges by producing piles of paperwork that \nexhaustively discuss every potential impact of the \nproposed action.\u201d  James T.B. Tripp & Nathan G. \nAlley, Streamlining NEPA\u2019s Environmental Review \nProcess:  Suggestions of Agency Reform, 12 N.Y.U. \nEnvtl. L.J. 74, 83 (2003).  Although that may \n\n7 \nsometimes help \u201ccreat[e] a \u2018bullet-proof\u2019 EIS,\u201d it also \nengenders \u201cprolonged delays\u201d in a world where \nagencies are working on hundreds of EISs at any given \ntime.  Id.; see Council on Envtl. Quality, Exec. Office \nof the Pres., A Citizen\u2019s Guide to NEPA, at 7 (Jan. \n2021); see also Length of Environmental Impact \nStatements, supra (acknowledging that \u201cthe length of \nEISs may be affected by agency considerations \nrelating to potential future legal challenges\u201d).   \nThis de-evolution has not gone unnoticed.  \nCongress has repeatedly adjusted the NEPA process \nwith an eye toward streamlining it.  See Linda Luther, \nCong. \nRsch. \nServ., \nRL33267, \nThe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA i (Dec. \n6, 2007), https://t.ly/0v5Dq; David Stepovich, Note, Is \nFAST-41 Permitting All that Fast? Why Congress \nMust Take a More Serious Approach to Streamlining \nFederal Permitting, 35 Geo. Envtl. L. Rev. 211 (2022).  \nThe recently enacted BUILDER Act\u2014shorthand for \n\u201cBuilding United States Infrastructure through \nLimited Delays and Efficient Reviews\u201d\u2014is the latest \nand arguably most emphatic of those developments.  \nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-\n5, \u00a7321, 137 Stat. 10, 38-49 (2023) (codified as \namended in scattered sections of Title 42 of the U.S. \nCode). \nAs its name makes obvious, the BUILDER Act \nsought to restore NEPA from the bloated, anti-\ndevelopment form it has taken on in the D.C. and \nNinth Circuits to the more modest procedure that \nCongress originally intended.  The Act requires \nagencies to finish most EISs within 2 years and \ngenerally limits EISs to 150 pages.  Id. at 41-43 \n\n8 \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a74336a(e)(1) & (g)-(h)).  The Act \nalso amends \u00a74332(2)(C) to clarify that\u2014as this Court \nhad long held under the prior version of the statute \nthat STB followed here\u2014agencies need only consider \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action,\u201d \u201creasonably foreseeable \nadverse environmental effects which cannot be \navoided,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable range of alternatives to \nthe proposed agency action \u2026 that are technically and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need \nof the proposal.\u201d  Id. at 38 (emphasis added) (codified \nat 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(iii)). \nB. Factual Background \nThe Uinta Basin is a 12,000-square-mile area\u2014\nroughly the size of Maryland\u2014primarily in northeast \nUtah.  Early Mormon explorers declared it a \u201cvast \n\u2018contiguity of waste\u2019 \u2026 valueless except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d  Christa Sadler, The Shape of the \nLand, \nCornerPost \n(Mar. \n24, \n2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LRVktj.  Today, its wild and open \nlandscape remains foreboding and sparsely populated, \nwith windy springs, baking summers, and freezing \nwinters.  See id.  At least until recently, its economy \nhas been similarly stark and isolated, with the \nrelevant counties all ranking in the bottom half of \nUtah for per capita income, and ranking even lower \nfor economic diversity.  Utah.Cert.Am.Br.4.  Its few \nresidents live off the land alongside members of the \nUte Indian Tribe, effectively cut off from the national \neconomy\u2014because the only way to reach the basin is \nover two-lane roads crossing high mountain passes, a \n\n9 \nnatural chokepoint raising costs, blocking diverse \ncommerce, and stifling local businesses.  Pet.App.7a. \nThe basin does have extensive deposits of \nvaluable minerals, including coal, phosphate, natural \ngas, gilsonite, natural asphalt, and, as especially \nrelevant here, waxy crude oil, a low-sulfur form of \npetroleum named for its shoe-polish-like consistency \nat ambient temperatures.  Pet.App.7a; see David \nTabet, Energy News: Development of New Markets for \nUinta Basin Crude via Rail, Utah Geological Survey \n(Jan. 2015), https://bit.ly/4d6VpW1; Tim Fitzpatrick, \nThe oil business is booming in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin, \nSalt \nLake \nTrib. \n(Aug. \n18, \n2023, \n9:21 \nAM), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yumUd9.  Those qualities make waxy \ncrude both more environmentally friendly to use and \nsafer to transport relative to others forms of crude\u2014\nthough transportation is expensive, because today it \nmust be shipped in heated tanker trucks.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra. \nOil producers in the Uinta Basin began exporting \nwaxy crude to markets outside of Utah in 2013.  See \nTabet, supra.  Ten years on, despite the limitations of \nexisting infrastructure, oil production is the basin\u2019s \nlargest industry, creating thousands of jobs and \ndriving up contributions to local tax revenues.  See \nFitzpatrick, supra.  As one local government official \nput it, \u201c[a]griculture is [the basin\u2019s] backbone, but oil \nand gas are [its] bread and butter.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \nformed as an independent political subdivision in 2014 \nwith the goal of connecting the Uinta Basin to the \nnational economy.  Seeking to benefit ranchers, \n\n10 \nfarmers, tribal citizens, and others, the Coalition \nfocused its efforts on rail\u2014a cheaper, safer, and \ncleaner alternative to trucking.  In partnership with \nUinta Basin Railway, LLC, the Coalition sought \napproval from STB to build a new 88-mile rail line \nrunning southwest from the basin to central Utah that \nwould carry diverse commodities to and from the heart \nof \nthe \nbasin \nvia \nthe \nnational \nrail \nnetwork.  \nPet.App.192a. \nThe successor to the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, \nSTB \n\u201cis \nan \nindependent \nfederal \nagency \u2026 charged with the economic regulation of \nvarious modes of surface transportation, primarily \nfreight rail,\u201d but extending to \u201ccertain passenger rail \nmatters, the intercity bus industry, non-energy \npipelines, \nhousehold \ngoods \ncarriers\u2019 \ntariffs, \nand \u2026 non-contiguous domestic water transportation\u201d \nbetween \u201cthe mainland United States, Hawaii, \nAlaska,\u201d and the territories.  Surface Transp. Bd., \nAbout STB, https://bit.ly/3AjwrUO (last visited Aug. \n28, 2024).  As relevant here, Congress made STB \nresponsible for authorizing construction of new \nrailroad lines.  See generally 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901.  \nResponsibility for safety, as distinct from economic, \nregulation of the rails lies elsewhere, in the Federal \nRailroad \nAdministration, \nhoused \nwithin \nthe \nTransportation Department.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin., About FRA, \nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/about-fra \n(last \nvisited Aug. 28, 2024).  Reflecting STB\u2019s relatively \nlimited remit, Congress requires members of the \nBoard to have experience in transportation, economic \nregulation, or business.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a71301(b)(2).   \n\n11 \n2. To help secure financing for the new rail line, \nthe Coalition asked STB to conditionally approve the \nUinta Basin Railway project pending full NEPA \nreview.  Pet.App.204a.  Multiple environmental \ngroups objected, including the Center for Biological \nDiversity, which argued, among other things, that the \nnew rail line would not be financially viable because \n(it said) the basin did not need additional crude-oil \ntransportation \ncapacity. \n \nPet.App.197a. \n \nSTB \nultimately granted conditional approval, but made \nclear that \u201c[c]onstruction may not begin unless and \nuntil the Board issues a final decision\u201d \u201caddressing \nany potential environmental impacts.\u201d  Pet.App.209a.  \nSTB began its NEPA review of the proposed \nrailway in 2019.  Roughly a year and a half later, it \nissued a draft EIS describing the environmental \neffects of three alternative rail alignments and a no-\nbuild alternative.  Pet.App.79a.  STB took the next ten \nmonths to finalize the EIS, reviewing thousands of \ncomments from the public and requesting a report \nfrom the Fish & Wildlife Service about the project\u2019s \nimpact on protected species of fish in the Upper \nColorado River basin.  Pet.App.10a-11a, 50a-51a.  The \nresulting final EIS spanned 3,600 pages and analyzed \nhow \u201cconstruction and operation of the Railway\u201d \nwould impact \u201cwater resources, air quality, special \nstatus species like the greater sage-grouse, land use \nand recreation, local economies, cultural resources, \nand the Ute Indian tribe,\u201d among other things.  \nPet.App.11a; see JA94-105 (EIS table of contents).   \nThe EIS extensively discussed the possibility that \nthe railway might export waxy crude.  \u201cTo the extent \nthat the crude oil would be refined into fuels that \n\n12 \nwould be combusted to produce energy, emissions \nfrom the combustion of the fuels would produce,\u201d \nunder the maximum production scenario, \u201c0.8% of \nnationwide [greenhouse gas] emissions and 0.1% of \nglobal [greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d  Pet.App.106a.  \nThe EIS predicted that roughly half of the oil would be \ndelivered to the Texas Gulf Coast, and another third \nto the Louisiana Gulf Coast, though it could not \n\u201cidentify specific refineries.\u201d  Pet.App.34a, 111a.   \nCloser to the project itself, the EIS estimated the \nnumber of oil wells that would be added in the Basin \ndue to increased oil production enabled by the rail \nproject, while acknowledging that the location of such \n\u201cas yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects\u201d was uncertain.  Pet.App.31a.  The EIS also \nstudied the impact of additional rail traffic on the \nnational rail system, using modeling and historical \ndata to \u201cdetermine[] that the new Railway would lead \nto increased downline traffic, ranging from 0.4 to 9.5 \ntrains per day\u201d and, at most, \u201c0.89 additional \npredicted accidents per year.\u201d  Pet.App.40a.  STB \nultimately concluded that these \u201cminimal increases in \ntrain traffic on existing rail lines over which trains \nalready operate [were] unlikely to cause significant \nimpacts\u201d to vehicle safety and delay, rail safety, noise \nand vibration, air quality, or greenhouse gases.  \nPet.App.110a.   \nIn the end, the EIS concluded that one of the \nalternative rail alignments (the \u201cWhitmore Park \nAlternative\u201d) would \u201cresult in the fewest significant \nimpacts on the environment.\u201d  Pet.App.115a.  The EIS \nalso \nrecommended \nextensive \nenvironmental \n\n13 \nmitigation conditions.  Pet.App.76a; see Pet.App.149a-\n189a.   \nAfter considering the EIS, the Fish & Wildlife \nService\u2019s biological opinion, a separate geological \nstudy evaluating the risk of landslides and other \ngeologic movements, and more, STB issued a final \ndecision approving construction and operation of the \nWhitmore Park Alternative, subject to the mitigation \nrecommendations.  Pet.App.10a-11a.  STB\u2019s final \napproval of the 88-mile railway tracked Congress\u2019 \ndirective in the agency\u2019s organic statute\u2014which \ninstructs STB to approve rail-construction proposals \n\u201cunless [it] finds that such activities are inconsistent \nwith the public convenience and necessity,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n\u00a710901(c); see Mid-States Coal. for Progress v. STB, \n345 F.3d 520, 552 (8th Cir. 2003) (\u00a710901 creates \u201ca \nstatutory presumption that rail construction is to be \napproved\u201d)\u2014as STB found no basis to conclude from \nthe EIS that any adverse impacts of the new rail line \nwould outweigh the benefits to public convenience and \nnecessity, particularly in light of the extensive \nmitigation requirements the EIS imposed.   \n3. Various environmental groups led by the \nCenter for Biological Diversity sought review of STB\u2019s \ndecision in the D.C. Circuit.  They were joined by \nEagle County, Colorado, which lies hundreds of miles \ndistant from the Uinta Basin, and is significantly \ncloser geographically to Denver than the Utah border.  \nThe court of appeals consolidated the cases and \nallowed Seven County and Uinta Basin Railway, LLC, \nto intervene in defense of STB\u2019s decision.   \nAs relevant here, the Center faulted the EIS for \nnot \u201canalyz[ing] the potential for tens of thousands of \n\n14 \nadditional barrels of oil shipments daily and their \nprocessing in [Gulf Coast] locales to further worsen \npollution burdens.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  The Center likewise \nturned the potential for the railway to spur economic \ndevelopment in a \u201cvast area\u201d against the project, \nflyspecking the EIS for failing to analyze the potential \nfor \u201cwell and road construction, drilling, and truck \ntraffic [to] destroy and degrade habitat.\u201d  Pet.App.30a.  \nAnd the Center knocked the EIS for not taking enough \nof \u201ca \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline,\u201d \u201cthe risk and impact of wildfires,\u201d or the \npotential impacts on \u201cthe Colorado River\u201d \u201cgiven the \nincreased rail traffic resulting from the Railway.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a, 46a. \nSTB\u2019s response was straightforward:  Under \nMetropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, it did not \nneed to consider those far-downstream (or down-track) \npotentialities, all of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited \nremit.  STB \u201ccannot regulate or mitigate\u201d any of the \nalleged potential \u201cimpacts\u201d the Center raised.  \nPet.App.31a.  Nor can it accurately predict them.  \n\u201c[A]ny \u2026 development in the Uinta Basin occurring as \na result of the [Railway] will be done in the future as \npart of as yet unknown and unplanned independent \nprojects that would occur on as yet unidentified \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(second alteration in original).  The amount of new \nconstruction is \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d given the \ninterplay between and among market forces, private \ndecisions, and regulatory actions outside STB\u2019s \ncontrol.  Pet.App.31a.  Likewise, although STB could \nidentify \u201cgeneral geographic regions\u201d where any oil \nmight go to be refined, \u201cthere [wa]s no way to predict \nor assess impacts to specific nearby communities from \n\n15 \nrefining that oil,\u201d because it was impossible to identify \nany one refinery.  Pet.App.31-32a.  And although STB \nestimated that marginal increases in rail traffic could \ncause 0.89 new accidents per year, accidents involving \na loaded crude train would occur far less frequently, \nand the evidence in the record suggested that \nmarginal wildfire risk \u201cwould not be significant.\u201d  \nPet.App.40a, 42a-43a, 46a.  \nNone of that was enough for the D.C. Circuit.  The \ndecision below concluded that STB\u2019s \u201cargument that it \nneed not consider effects it cannot prevent is simply \ninapplicable.\u201d  Pet.App.37a.  The court further held \nthat STB \u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could \nnot employ \u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the \naforementioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  \nPet.App.35a.  Invoking its decision in Sabal Trail, the \ncourt found that by taking the trouble to trace \nincreased waxy crude production in rural Utah to \nrefineries on the Gulf Coast, STB had bound itself to \ngo further to analyze the impact of refining activities \non Gulf Coast communities, including contributions to \nclimate \nchange. \n \nPet.App.33a-36a; \nsee \nalso \nPet.App.66a.  The court thus vacated the order and \nremanded for STB to redo the EIS.  Pet.App.70a-71a.1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA imposes a sensible procedural requirement \nthat federal agencies consider a proposed project\u2019s \nenvironmental impact before greenlighting it.  It is not \nsupposed to operate as a substantive obstacle to \n \n1 The D.C. Circuit also remanded for STB to address non-NEPA \nissues and for Fish & Wildlife to address an aspect of its biological \nopinion.  Those non-NEPA issues are not before this Court. \n\n16 \nprojects, requiring agencies to consider remote \npossibilities or empowering project opponents to win a \nwar of attrition by repeatedly forcing agencies to \nconsider just one more possibility.  This Court\u2019s \nprecedents ensure that NEPA strikes a reasonable \nbalance by limiting an agency\u2019s obligations to \nconsidering environmental effects with a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d to the agency\u2019s proposed \naction, and then reviewing the agency\u2019s analysis \nunder NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774; Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  The D.C. \nCircuit has lost sight of those limits, as this case \ndramatically illustrates.  STB studied all that NEPA \nrequires and then some in a 3,600-page EIS, but \nenvironmental \nobjectors \nand \nthe \nD.C. \nCircuit \ndemanded still more, including an exhaustive review \nof matters as remote as the impact of additional oil \nrefining (that the new railway theoretically could \nspur) on air quality on the Gulf Coast.  Invoking its \nSabal Trail decision, the D.C. Circuit effectively \npunished STB for going beyond what NEPA requires, \nholding that STB\u2019s efforts to trace increased crude \nproduction to Gulf Coast refineries obligated it to \nstudy environmental effects thousands of miles \nremoved from the project at issue.  There is simply no \nrole under NEPA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s precedents for \nstymying \ndevelopment \nprojects \nbased \non \nenvironmental effects that are so wildly remote in \ngeography and time.  This Court should reaffirm that \nNEPA embodies a demanding form of proximate \ncause, not mere but-for causation, and reverse. \nThis Court has been clear.  \u201cNEPA requires\u201d \nstudying an environmental effect only when there is \n\u201c\u2018a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u2019\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\n17 \n\u201cproximate \ncause\u201d\u2014\u201cbetween \nthe \nenvironmental \neffect and the alleged cause,\u201d and only when the \nagency \u201chas \u2026 statutory authority over\u201d the \u201ceffect,\u201d \nand thus the \u201cability to prevent\u201d it.  Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. at 767, 770 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at \n774).  While the D.C. Circuit cited this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, it required STB\u2019s NEPA analysis to \ntransgress the limits of proximate cause and STB\u2019s \npurview, while giving STB no leeway to make \nreasonable judgments about dim and distant effects. \nThat was legal error.  This Court\u2019s repeated \nemphasis on proximate cause and \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship[s]\u201d between a project and its \nenvironmental effects, Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nrules out the need to consider effects that are far \nremoved in geography and time or that are separated \nby multiple intervening causes that themselves are \nnon-environmental and highly uncertain.  It strains \ncredulity to contend that laying 88 miles of track in \nrural Utah is proximately related to climate change or \nenvironmental harm in Gulf Coast communities.  So \ntoo for potential downline train accidents:  It beggars \nbelief that the legally relevant (i.e., proximate) cause \nof an accident several States away could somehow be \nthe Uinta Basin Railway\u2014and not, for instance, the \nengineer of the relevant train, the train manufacturer, \nor the operator of the relevant track.  Even if the \nproject could be said to be the but-for cause, a tort \nplaintiff suing the agency or the Uinta Basin Railway \nfor a train accident a thousand miles away (let alone \nfor climate change) would be laughed out of court.  The \nresult should be no different just because plaintiffs \nchallenge an EIS under NEPA.  \u201c\u2018[F]or want of a nail, \na kingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \n\n18 \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv\u2019r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nThe decision below also defies NEPA\u2019s \u201cpractical \n\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u201d  N.Y. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. \nKleppe, 97 S.Ct. 4, 6 (1976) (decision of Marshall, J.).  \nNEPA requires agencies to consider proposals \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), not track down \nevery remote or minimal impact.  As one moves from \nthe direct effects of the project to increasingly remote \neffects and mere risks, the agency has discretion to \nignore them or give them more cursory treatment, and \nthe rule of reason prevents a court from forcing an \nagency to consider \u201cinformation\u201d that the agency \ndeems of little \u201cvalue\u201d to the \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 374 \n(1989).  For example, whatever the proper solution to \nglobal climate change, the issue must be addressed \nglobally (or at least nationally by EPA), not by \nblocking an 88-mile rail line bringing much-needed \neconomic stability and development to a remote corner \nof Utah.  In practical terms, \u201cno rule of reason worthy \nof that title,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767, would \n\u201coblige\u201d an agency responsible for approving rail \nprojects \n\u201cto \nexpend \nconsiderable \nresources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise\u201d on issues \u201cnot otherwise \nrelevant to [its] congressionally assigned functions,\u201d \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776; see also Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 769.   \nThe decision below is a poster child for converting \na sensible procedural check into a morass that \n\n19 \noperates as a substantive roadblock to development.  \nThe clearest way to put an end to this excess is for this \nCourt to reverse and make clear that the EIS here is \nsufficient.  88 miles of track should not require 3,600 \npages of EIS, let alone a remand for further study of \nwildly remote matters.  This Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nText And Precedent Answer The Question \nPresented In The Negative. \nA. This \nCourt \nHas \nMade \nClear \nThat \nProximate Cause and a Rule of Reason \nSensibly Limit the Scope of NEPA \nReview. \n1. This Court decided Metropolitan Edison in \n1983, four years after a high-profile accident at the \nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant prompted mass \nevacuations and a national reckoning about the safety \nof nuclear power.  Immediately following the accident, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) ordered \nthe power company to shutter the plant indefinitely.  \n460 U.S. at 769.  When the power company sought \npermission to resume operations, the Atomic Energy \nAct required NRC to act as \u201cnecessary or desirable \u2026 \nto protect health or to minimize danger to life or \nproperty.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b).  NEPA also required \nthe Commission to prepare an EIS.  In Metropolitan \nEdison, this Court addressed what environmental \nimpacts NRC needed to consider under NEPA before \nauthorizing Three Mile Island operations to resume. \nThe Court began with statutory text.  Under the \nversion then in effect, NEPA required agencies to \nstudy \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed \naction\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmental effects which \n\n20 \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal \nbe \nimplemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1975).  As \nthen-Justice Rehnquist explained, this language did \nnot mean that NEPA required the Commission to \nconsider every possible adverse effect of restarting \nThree Mile Island.  460 U.S. at 774.  Rather, \u201cthe \nterms \u2018environmental effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental \nimpact\u2019\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably \nclose \ncausal \nrelationship\u201d \nakin \nto \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d \u201cbetween\u201d the agency action \u201cand \nthe effect at issue.\u201d  Id.; see also Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 \n(2014) (explaining the settled principle that federal \nstatutes often should be \u201cconstrued \u2026 to incorporate a \nrequirement of proximate causation\u201d). \nWith that statutory construction in hand, the \nCourt unanimously concluded that things like the \n\u201crelease of low-level radiation, increased fog in the \nHarrisburg area (caused by operation of the plant\u2019s \ncooling towers), and the release of warm water into the \nSusquehanna River\u201d were properly on the table for \nNEPA purposes.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775.  \nThese effects, after all, were \u201cproximately related\u201d to \nthe plant resuming operations.  Id. at 774.   \nOn the flip side, the Commission\u2019s EIS did not \nneed to account for \u201cthe potential psychological health \neffects\u201d of reopening the plant on members of the \nsurrounding community, let alone the impact on far-\nflung relatives living hundreds or thousands of miles \naway.  Id. at 771, 774, 777-78.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court did not deny that locals were \nstill reeling from the recent brush with disaster, or \nthat reopening the plant \u201cmay well cause\u201d residents to \n\n21 \nsuffer \n\u201cpsychological \nhealth \nproblems \n\u2026 \nand \naccompanying physical disorders\u201d that derive from \n\u201c\u2018tension and fear.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 774.  But NEPA is \nconcerned with effects of agency action on \u201cthe \nphysical environment\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201c\u2018the air, land and \nwater\u2019\u201d\u2014and such harms were \u201csimply too remote \nfrom the physical environment to justify requiring the \nNRC to evaluate the psychological health damage \u2026 \nthat may be caused by renewed operation of [the \nplant].\u201d  Id. at 773, 774 (emphasis omitted). \nFurthermore, the resumption of operations was \nnot the proximate cause of the health effects \nrespondents raised; those effects instead would \u201cflow \ndirectly from the risk of [a nuclear] accident.\u201d  Id. at \n775 (emphasis added; alteration in original) (quoting \nMetro. Edison Br. for Resps. 23).  \u201cBut a risk of an \naccident is not an effect on the physical environment\u201d \neither.  Id.  \u201cA risk is, by definition, unrealized in the \nphysical world.\u201d  Id. at 767.  What matters under \nNEPA\u2014and what defines the scope of review\u2014is the \nrelationship between the project at issue and changes \nin the physical environment caused by it.  \u201cNEPA does \nnot require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua \nrisk,\u201d of a project moving forward, as opposed to the \nreasonably foreseeable effects of the project itself.  Id. \nat 779.   \nFinally, the Court warned against allowing NEPA \nto be converted into a vehicle for environmental policy \ndisputes.  \u201cThe political process, and not NEPA, \nprovides the appropriate forum in which to air policy \ndisagreements.\u201d  Id. at 777. \nMetropolitan Edison all but resolves this case.  If \nNEPA did not require consideration of allegedly direct \n\n22 \nhealth consequences of the ripped-from-the-headlines \nrisk of another nuclear meltdown before restarting \nThree Mile Island, then it is hard to demand that \nSTB\u2019s EIS here consider the risk of accidents on \nexisting tracks hundreds of miles away, let alone the \nremote and theoretical risk that the Uinta Basin \nRailway could cause future harm to communities near \nGulf Coast refineries.  But if any doubt remained post-\nMetropolitan Edison, Public Citizen settled it. \n2. The question in Public Citizen was whether, \nwhen deciding what safety regulations should govern \nMexican trucks operating in the United States, the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration needed \nto consider the Mexican trucks\u2019 contribution to \ndomestic air pollution.  541 U.S. at 756.  Unlike \nMetropolitan Edison, the question was not risk\u2014e.g., \nthe \nrisk \nthat \nMexican \ntrucks \nwould \nhave \nenvironmentally damaging accidents in the United \nStates or impact traffic patterns in ways that affected \ndistant communities\u2014but the certainty that Mexican \ntrucks would cause additional air pollution.  After all, \nthe regulations were the last thing standing in the \nway of President Bush\u2019s directive to allow Mexican \ntrucks to operate in the United States.  Id. at 765-66.   \nNevertheless, even though the agency action was \nplainly the but-for cause of that increased pollution, \nthe Court concluded that it landed outside NEPA\u2019s \nrequired scope.  Id. at 770.  The Court clarified that \u201ca \n\u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is insufficient to make an \nagency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA \nand the relevant regulations.\u201d  Id. at 767.  Rather, \nNEPA requires agencies to consider only those effects \nproximately caused by the proposed action.  Id.  Given \n\n23 \nthe President\u2019s order, the agency could not simply \ndecline to issue regulations, and so\u2014while the agency \naction allowing the Mexican trucks into the country \nwas plainly a but-for cause of increased pollution\u2014\n\u201cthe President,\u201d \u201cnot\u201d any \u201caction\u201d by the agency, was \n\u201cthe legally relevant cause.\u201d  Id. at 760-61, 769; see \nalso id. at 767 (noting that \u201cproximate cause analysis \nturns on,\u201d among other things, \u201cconsiderations of the \n\u2018legal responsibility\u2019 of actors\u201d (quoting W. Page \nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 275 \n(5th ed. 1984))). \nThe Court likewise invoked NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason,\u201d which ensures that agencies need not engage \nin endless environmental reviews that would frustrate \nthe agency\u2019s primary mission or \u201cserve no purpose in \nlight of NEPA\u2019s regulatory scheme as a whole.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents there argued that while the President\u2019s \ndecision required the agency to allow the trucks into \nthe country, the agency still needed to consider \npollution, on the theory that it might matter on the \nmargins when selecting among the menu of possible \nsafety regulations.  This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would require an \nagency\u201d against its will to study environmental effects \nfalling outside its \u201cability to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 767, 770.   \n3. Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen suffice \nto resolve this case in petitioners\u2019 favor, but they are \nfar from the only decisions of this Court holding that \nonly proximate environmental effects count, and an \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis need not consider remote \nenvironmental effects, non-environmental effects, \npure risk, or matters beyond the agency\u2019s remit. \n\n24 \nIn Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \nfor instance, the Forest Service authorized the \ndevelopment of a major new ski resort in a \u201csparsely \npopulated area\u201d of the Cascade Mountains.  490 U.S. \nat 337.  The resort quickly got bogged down in \nlitigation.  Environmental groups challenged the \nadequacy of the EIS, which recognized that off-site \ndevelopment on private land \u201ccould \u2026 degrad[e] \u2026 \nexisting air quality\u201d but did not delve deeply into the \nair-quality issue.  Id. at 339-40, 344-45.  They further \nargued the EIS needed to conduct a \u201cworst case\u201d \nanalysis of impacts to the local mule-deer population \nand that the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that those \neffects were \u201cuncertain[]\u201d did not suffice.  Id. at 343, \n347.  This Court rejected both arguments with a nod \nto NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of reason.\u201d  Because the county, not \nthe Forest Service, had primary jurisdiction over air \nquality, \u201c[t]he off-site effects on air quality and on the \nmule deer herd\u201d would \u201cbe subject to regulation by \nother \ngovernmental \nbodies\u201d \nwith \nprimary \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the effects and \u201cauthority to \nmitigate them.\u201d  Id. at 350, 352.  \u201c[I]t would be \nincongruous to conclude that the Forest Service\u201d was \nresponsible to develop related mitigation measures.  \nId. at 352-53.2 \n \n2 Unfortunately, that conclusion was not enough to save the \nresort:  Despite heralding the region as \u201cthe best potential \ndestination ski resort in the United States,\u201d Aspen Ski \nCorporation ultimately \u201cbec[a]me weary of the seemingly never-\nending lawsuits\u201d and sold the property to another developer, who \nitself \u201cran out of cash\u201d after \u201cspen[ding] roughly $12 million on \nland and legal fees.\u201d  Ryan Flynn, Early Winters Resort, WA:  A \nSki Hill That Never Was, SnowBrains (Jan. 8, 2024), \n \n\n25 \nThe Court reached a similar conclusion for similar \nreasons in Vermont Yankee.  There, the Court brushed \nback the suggestion that an EIS must \u201cferret out every \npossible\u201d way to mitigate environmental effects, \nparticularly when those effects fall into the domain of \n\u201cstate public utility commissions or similar bodies.\u201d  \n435 U.S. at 550-51, 558.  And in Baltimore Gas and \nElectric, this Court blessed NRC\u2019s use of generic rules \nto evaluate the environmental effects of nuclear power \ngeneration generally, rather than via a power-plant-\nspecific analysis.  As the Court there put it, \u201cCongress \ndid not enact NEPA \u2026 so that an agency would \ncontemplate the environmental impact of an action as \nan abstract exercise\u201d; agencies \u201cha[ve] discretion\u201d \nunder \nNEPA \nto \n\u201ccho[ose]\u201d \nto \n\u201cevaluate \n\u2026 \nenvironmental impact[s]\u201d \u201cgenerically,\u201d rather than \nspecifically, to \u201cfurther[]\u201d \u201c[a]dministrative efficiency \nand consistency of decision.\u201d  462 U.S. at 100-01. \n* * * \nThe lessons of this Court\u2019s NEPA cases are clear, \nyet they all seemed lost on the D.C. Circuit in its \ndecision below.  NEPA requires agencies to study only \nenvironmental effects proximately caused by the \nproposed agency action.  NEPA does not require \nagencies to study remote environmental effects, non-\nenvironmental effects, risks, or factors outside the \nagency\u2019s control.  Nor does an agency have to consider \nevery effect that may (or may not) flow from conduct \nor events that a proposed project may (or may not) \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4fAPp9W.  That result underscores the risk that \nNEPA litigation allows environmental opponents of agency-\napproved projects to lose the NEPA battle while still winning the \nwar of attrition. \n\n26 \nspur, just because the agency could ensure that those \npotential future consequences never arise by denying \na permit and cutting off the proposed action \naltogether.  Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nboth say so directly and confirm that the D.C. Circuit \nerred in requiring STB to consider far-downstream \nconsequences as part of its NEPA review.   \nThat proximate-cause limit tethered to the project \nitself is buttressed by NEPA\u2019s rule of reason, which \nputs sensible limits on what an agency must study.  In \nPublic Citizen, even though pollution from Mexican \ntrucks was a certain, direct environmental effect of the \nFederal \nMotor \nCarrier \nSafety \nAdministration \npromulgating its safety regulations, the agency did \nnot need to study pollution from increased truck \ntraffic, because the agency \u201cha[d] no statutory \nauthority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to \nestablish environmental requirements unrelated to \nmotor carrier safety.\u201d  541 U.S. at 759.  Likewise in \nRobertson, even if air pollution from off-site \ndevelopment was a certain, direct environmental \neffect of licensing the ski resort, the Forest Service \nwould not need to study it, because it would fall within \nthe County\u2019s authority.  Once again, those cases \nconfirm that the D.C. Circuit erred in holding that \nSTB must conduct a full-scale NEPA review of issues \nfar outside its limited remit, but well within the \npurview of other agencies\u2019 authority\u2014especially when \nthose other agencies can address such issues more \ncomprehensively, rather than making a relatively \nmodest infrastructure project the scapegoat for \neverything from upstream mining to downstream \naccident risks and climate change. \n\n27 \nB. The \nBUILDER \nAct \nButtresses \nthe \nLimitations on NEPA Review That This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Recognize and Enforce. \nThis Court has long \u201capplied the standard \nrequirement of proximate cause to actions under \nfederal statutes\u201d even though \u201cthe text did not \nexpressly provide for it.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nMcBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting).  As of 2023, NEPA\u2019s text does provide for \nit.  While not directly applicable to this pre-Act project, \nCongress codified in the BUILDER Act what this \nCourt has long held, making clear that the scope of \nNEPA \nreview \nturns \non \nforeseeability \nand \nreasonableness\u2014i.e., proximate cause\u2014and that \nNEPA does not alter statutory provisions delimiting \nan agency\u2019s authority or mission. \nAs amended by the BUILDER Act, NEPA now \nprovides as follows: \n(2) [A]ll agencies of the Federal Government \nshall\u2014 \n(C) \u2026 except where compliance would be \ninconsistent \nwith \nother \nstatutory \nrequirements, \ninclude \nin \nevery \nrecommendation or report on proposals for \nlegislation and other major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on\u2014 \n(i) \nthe \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nenvironmental impact effects of the \nproposed agency action,; \n\n28 \n(ii) \nany \nreasonably \nforeseeable \nadverse environmental effects which \ncannot \nbe \navoided \nshould \nthe \nproposal be implemented,; [and] \n(iii) \na \nreasonable \nrange \nof \nalternatives to the proposed agency \naction, including an analysis of any \nnegative environmental impacts of \nnot \nimplementing \nthe \nproposed \nagency action in the case of a no \naction \nalternative, \nthat \nare \ntechnically \nand \neconomically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposal[.]  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a74332 (2023) (additions underlined; \ndeletions stricken). \nThese \nclarifying \nchanges \nunderscore \nthat \nCongress has embraced this Court\u2019s decisions, which \nkeep NEPA as a manageable procedural check, rather \nthan a substantive roadblock to infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The BUILDER Act makes explicit what \nthis Court already held was implicit by textually \nadopting the language of proximate cause.  See, e.g., \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) \n(proximate cause is \u201coften explicated in terms of \nforeseeability\u201d).  That strongly reinforces this Court\u2019s \ndecisions.  After all, if Congress can \u201ccarry forward\u201d \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nstatutory \nprecedents \nmerely \nby \n\u201cperpetuating the [same] wording\u201d (i.e., doing nothing \nin response to this Court\u2019s statutory decisions), then \nCongress\u2019 affirmative choice to adopt new language \nembracing prior statutory precedents of this Court \nsupplies a strong signal that those precedents were \n\n29 \ncorrect.  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \nThe BUILDER Act likewise embraces the rule of \nreason recognized in Public Citizen.  The Act\u2019s title \nunderscores Congress\u2019 intent for NEPA review to be \nnarrow and efficient, rather than unwieldy and anti-\ndevelopment.  See id. at 221 (noting that statutory \ntitles provide a \u201cpermissible indicator[] of meaning\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the Act continues to limit NEPA to projects \n\u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and it now \nexpressly \nabsolves \nagencies \nof \nconsidering \nalternatives \nthat \nare \nnot \n\u201creasonable,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) (2023), and presumptively limits the \nEIS process to no more than \u201c2 years\u201d and an EIS itself \nto \u201c150 pages,\u201d id. \u00a74336a(e)(1), (g)(1).  What is more, \nit makes explicit that when Congress assigns an \nagency to administer a decidedly pro-development \nstatute\u2014as \nit \nhas \ndone \nwith \nSTB \nand \nrail \nconstruction, see p.10, supra\u2014NEPA does not stand in \nthe way; the agency need only weigh alternatives that \n\u201cmeet the purpose and need of the proposal\u201d and \nevaluate the cost of doing nothing.  Id. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii) \n(2023).   \nAt bottom, the BUILDER Act not only endorses \nthis Court\u2019s focus on proximate cause and underscores \nthat limits on an agency\u2019s regulatory mission and its \nsubject-matter portfolio are baked into the rule of \nreason, but illustrates the folly in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nboil-the-ocean mandate here. \n\n30 \nII. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA And This \nCourt\u2019s Cases Applying It.   \nThis Court\u2019s NEPA precedents and Congress\u2019 \nrecent and emphatic reaffirmation of them confirm \nthat NEPA envisions a procedural cross-check, not a \nsubstantive roadblock.  And NEPA\u2019s procedural cross-\ncheck is not designed to be unduly onerous or to \nresemble a Sisyphean task, where there is always one \nadditional and increasingly remote effect or risk that \nmust be considered.  To the contrary, NEPA strikes a \nsensible balance where an agency need only consider \nproximate environmental effects and judgments about \nwhat to consider are protected from endless second-\nguessing by a rule of reason.  Striking this balance \nensures that NEPA will continue to facilitate \u201cfully \ninformed and well-considered decision[s]\u201d while \nremaining \u201cbounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551, 558.  It likewise ensures that \n\u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA, provides the \nappropriate \nforum \nin \nwhich \nto \nair \npolicy \ndisagreements\u201d with a project that meets all the \nsubstantive criteria for agency approval.  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 777. \nThe decision below upsets that balance and \nthreatens to block vital infrastructure development \nunder the guise of just a little more process.  The \nimpact (if any) of 88 new miles of track in an isolated \ncorner of Utah on train accidents hundreds of miles \naway or the air quality of refining communities on the \nGulf Coast or on climate change is the very definition \nof remote, not proximate, cause.  And despite the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s view that NEPA demands a never-ending \nprocess, it was eminently reasonable for an agency \n\n31 \nresponsible for administering an explicitly pro-\ndevelopment statute to decline to consider de minimis \nenvironmental impacts that are little more than the \ninevitable consequences of development and that \nshould be regulated (if at all) as part of a \ncomprehensive scheme administered by a different \nagency.  To state the obvious, the solution to the global \nissue of climate change does not lie in blocking 88 \nmiles of track or keeping the Uinta Basin isolated from \nthe national economy.   \nA. The \nDecision \nBelow \nDemanded \nConsideration of Non-Proximate and \nNon-Environmental Effects. \n1. If a train collision occurs in the middle of \nColorado and winds up in court, there are plenty of \npotential tort defendants:  the hapless train engineer, \nthe careless builder of the malfunctioning train, the \nmanufacturer of the unsafe track, the negligent \ndispatcher who was on duty, or perhaps even the \nreckless safety regulator who ignored advice to lower \nthe relevant speed limit.  Only the most creative of \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2014and least successful, given the \nwell-established limits of proximate cause\u2014would \nthink to sue the operator of an 88-mile rail line that \nbegins and ends in rural Utah or the regulator who \napproved it on the theory that it increased downline \naccident risk by less than a percentage point. \nThat would be true a fortiori for consequences on \nthe ground (or in the air above it) from increased waxy \ncrude refining on the Gulf Coast\u2014and doubly so of \neffects of such refining on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as \nchanges or increases in refining are strictly regulated \nby other agencies.  Not even Helen Palsgraf could have \n\n32 \ndreamed of a judicial opinion finding 88 miles of track \nwholly in rural Utah to be the proximate cause of \nfuture air pollution on the Gulf Coast and its \nramifications for Gulf refining communities\u2014to say \nnothing of one linking the railway to monsoons in the \nSouth Pacific.   \nWhile well-established principles of proximate \ncause would stop such fanciful lawsuits at the starting \ngate, the D.C. Circuit put STB on the hook for \nstudying similarly remote effects of approving 88 \nmiles of rail line in rural Utah.  The D.C. Circuit \njustified that burden not by expressly finding air \npollution on the Gulf Coast or downline accidents to be \nproximately caused by the project, but by emphasizing \nthat STB has the authority to deny the permit \nnecessary for the project if it \u201cfinds that such activities \nare inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d  See Pet.App.36a-37a; 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901(c). \nThat analytical leap hopelessly conflates but-for \nand proximate cause.  An agency can avoid any \nnumber of remote impacts and risks of harmful \nactivity by denying a required permit, because the \nvery nature of a permit makes it a necessary but-for \ncause of the permitted activity.  But this Court has \nrepeatedly rejected the notion that NEPA embodies \nsuch a \u201c\u2018but-for\u2019 causation\u201d standard.  Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 767.  In its place, and in order to protect \nthe \u201cmanageable\u201d and balanced approach that \nCongress intended, see Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776, \nNEPA requires agencies to study only proximate \nenvironmental effects.  In light of \u201cthe congressional \nconcerns that led to the enactment of NEPA,\u201d \u201c[s]ome \neffects\u201d of a proposed project \u201cthat are \u2018caused by\u2019 a \n\n33 \nchange in the physical environment in the sense of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation, will nonetheless not fall within [NEPA] \nbecause the causal chain is too attenuated.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nStated more succinctly, proximate cause is the \ntouchstone for an EIS\u2014and where proximate cause \nends, so ends the scope of what NEPA requires.   \nMoreover, as this Court has emphasized, the focus \nof the proximate-cause inquiry is on the project itself, \nnot on subsequent activities a project may someday \nenable.  See id. at 771-79; pp.20-21, supra.  NEPA \nrequires \u201ca detailed statement\u201d of \u201cthe environmental \nimpact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2019) \n(emphases added).3  Thus, \u201cto decide what kind of an \n[EIS] need be prepared, it is necessary first to describe \naccurately the \u2026 \u2018action\u2019 being taken.\u201d  Aberdeen & \nRockfish R.R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U.S. 289, 322 (1975); \nsee also Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 395-402 \n(1976).  And the same is true for the proximate-cause \ninquiry.  \u201cTo determine whether [NEPA] requires \nconsideration of a particular effect, we must look at \nthe relationship between that effect and the change in \nthe physical environment caused by the major federal \naction at issue.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773 \n(emphasis added).  What matters, in other words, is \nthe relationship between the project and changes in \nthe physical environment caused by it.  \n \n3 The language under the BUILDER Act is substantially \nsimilar.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (2023) (requiring \u201ca detailed \nstatement\u201d of, inter alia, \u201creasonably foreseeable environmental \neffects of the proposed agency action\u201d and \u201calternatives to the \nproposed agency action\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnder that rubric, changes in the physical \nenvironment that have a reasonably close causal \nrelationship to a proposed project must be considered \nas part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review.  But changes in \nthe physical environment that are remote from a \nproposed project in space and time need not be \nconsidered as part of an agency\u2019s NEPA review, \nbecause \nthose \neffects \nare, \nby \ndefinition, \nnot \nproximately caused by the project.  Likewise, \nenvironmental effects that flow from subsequent \nactions that the project may (or may not) ultimately \nenable need not be considered under NEPA, as such \nuncertain potentialities likewise lie well beyond the \nscope of proximate environmental effects. \nThat sensible proximate-cause limit focused on \nthe project itself is reinforced by NEPA\u2019s direction to \nconsider alternatives.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C)(iii).  \nIt makes perfect sense for an agency to consider three \nalternative rail routes to connect the Uinta Basin with \nthe national rail system, as well as a no-action \nalternative.  See pp.11-13, supra.  If one route \nendangers important habitat or threatens a pristine \nriver, then the EIS helpfully directs the agency to an \nalternative.  But it is completely infeasible to consider \nevery alternative for the cargo that could be carried on \ndistant rail lines, the development the rail line could \nprecipitate in the Uinta Basin, or the permutations for \nthe mix and quantity of crude refined on the Gulf \nCoast.  And NEPA directs agencies to consider all \nalternatives in the same manner, not to go to the ends \nof the Earth vis-\u00e0-vis the principal proposal and give \nonly cursory consideration to the alternatives.  Thus, \nthe only conclusion consistent with NEPA\u2019s text and \nthe imperative to keep NEPA analysis within \n\n35 \nreasonable bounds is to consider only a manageable \nrange of proximate environmental effects of all \nalternatives.  Any other conclusion would leave \nagencies (and courts) with impossible burdens and \nwithout \u201ca manageable line between those causal \nchanges that may make an actor responsible for an \neffect and those that do not.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767 (quoting Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7). \n2. The D.C. Circuit lost sight of these important \nprinciples here.  The court of appeals perceived three \nfailings in the EIS:  failing to adequately consider \n(1) \u201cthe effects of increased crude oil refining on Gulf \nCoast \ncommunities \nin \nLouisiana \nand \nTexas\u201d; \n(2) \u201cdownline effects of projected increases in spills \nand accidents from additional oil trains traveling the \nexisting Union Pacific rail line\u201d; and (3) the \u201cupline \nimpacts on vegetation or special status species\u201d that \nmight be found near potential well sites if the new \nrailway \nspurs \nindependent \ndevelopment.  \nPet.App.12a-13a; see also Pet.App.30a-37a, 40a-47a.   \nJust quoting those supposedly \u201comitted\u201d impacts \nconfirms that the D.C. Circuit went well beyond \nproximate environmental effects of adding 88 miles of \nrail in rural Utah.  First, any impact on Gulf Coast \ncommunities in Louisiana and Texas is wildly remote \nin multiple dimensions.  There are multiple States, \nand more than a thousand miles, between the 88 miles \nof track in Utah and the Gulf Coast.   \nAnd there is arguably an even greater gap \nbetween the project and any material increase in \ncrude oil refining in those remote areas.  Even \ncrediting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s apparent assumption that \nall crude shipped on a common-carrier rail line will \n\n36 \nend up at a specific destination in the Gulf Coast, \nwhether there will even be an increase in crude oil \nrefining on the Gulf Coast depends on the amount of \nwaxy crude shipped on the new line and how that \ncompares to the status quo ante with truck \ntransportation, see CADCJA230, \u201cthe ability and \nwillingness\u201d of the refineries in those areas to receive \nand process waxy crude oil, JA477, and (among many \nother things) the actions of myriad local, state, and \nfederal regulators who already directly oversee the \nrefineries\u2019 operations.  Figuring out \u201cthe climate \neffects of the combustion of the fuel intended to be \nextracted\u201d thus depends on guessing which part (or \nparts) of the Gulf Coast might receive and refine the \noil; speculating whether and to what degree waxy \ncrude from the Uinta Basin will augment existing \nrefining activity, rather than just displace refining \ncrude from elsewhere (and, if so, what kind of crude is \ndisplaced); estimating the relative impacts of refining \none form of crude versus another; and then inferring \nthat the environmental protections already in place \n(due to action by EPA and state regulators, not STB) \nwould fail to protect the surrounding community from \nany marginal increase in refining output.  All of those \nare \u201cmiddle links\u201d that render \u201cthe effects of increased \ncrude oil refining on Gulf Coast communities in \nLouisiana and Texas\u201d far too remote from a new \nrailway line in rural Utah and far too speculative to \njustify NEPA review of those highly contingent \npotentialities.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 775. \nThe \u201cdownline\u201d effects of STB\u2019s decision are, if \nanything, even more contingent and remote.  As part \nof its NEPA review, STB used models to predict how \nmany trains would be added to other rail lines.  Based \n\n37 \non that prediction, STB estimated that the additional \ntrain cars would result in less than one\u20140.89, to be \nexact\u2014additional \ntrain \naccident \neach \nyear.  \nPet.App.40a-41a.  And even that number oversells the \npoint.  Where such an accident would occur; whether \nit would be serious or minor; whether it would involve \ncars that were empty or full; and whether it would \ncause any damage to the physical environment \nhundreds or thousands of miles removed from the \nUinta Basin are all matters of complete guesswork.  As \nnoted, any plaintiff trying to sue the operators of the \n88 miles of rural Utah track (or STB) for a train \naccident in Colorado, Louisiana, or anywhere in \nbetween would be laughed out of court.  The most that \ncould be said is that STB approval of the 88 miles at \nissue here was a but-for cause of the future accident.  \nTo argue that the accident was a proximate \nenvironmental effect drains those words of meaning \nand defies this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThe same is true of the potential that, if the \nrailway spurs new development in the Uinta Basin, \nthat new development may have effects on the \nsurrounding environs.  See Pet.App.31a.  Initially, \nthat risk depends on the assumption that the new rail \nline will carry substantial amounts of waxy crude\u2014by \nno means a certainty, as evidenced by the fact that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity previously contended \nthat market demand for oil could never sustain the \nrailway. \n \nSee \nPet.App.197a-198a. \n \nAnd \nthe \nassumptions spin out from there.  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nown \ndescription \nof \nSTB\u2019s \nsupposed \nomissions \nunderscores that it has gone well beyond proximate \nenvironmental effects of the project itself.  The D.C. \nCircuit demanded consideration of \u201cas yet unknown \n\n38 \nand unplanned independent projects that would occur \non as yet unidentified private, state, tribal, or federal \nland,\u201d \u201cundertaken \u2018by as yet unknown entities and \nlicensed or permitted by other federal agencies, state \nand local governments, or the Ute Tribe, depending on \nthe location of the development,\u2019\u201d at a level that is \n\u201csimply unknown and unknowable.\u201d  Pet.App.31a \n(quoting CADC.Gov.Br.35-36).  The court should have \nstopped well before the fourth \u201cunknown.\u201d  None of \nthose unknowns is a proximate consequence of the \nproject, as opposed to a potential consequence of \nindependent development that the project may (or \nmay not) spur and that could pose some harm to the \nenvironment, \ndespite \nwhatever \nenvironmental \nanalysis is required if, and when, any concrete future \nprojects materialize. \nTo be sure, an agency must make some educated \nassumptions about environmental effects that are \ncertain but hard to quantify, to \u201censure[] that [those] \nimportant \neffects \nwill \nnot \nbe \noverlooked \nor \nunderestimated,\u201d and to \u201cprovide[] a springboard for \npublic comment.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.  In \nMetropolitan Edison, for example, NRC needed to \nmake educated assumptions about the \u201crelease of low-\nlevel radiation, increased fog in the [surrounding] area \n(caused by operation of the plant\u2019s cooling towers), and \nthe release of warm water into [a nearby] River.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 775.  But those were all actual effects of the \nproject itself.  Environmental consequences that may \n(or may not) arise if a project spurs other conduct (i.e., \nother non-environmental consequences) are not \nproximate effects of a project.  The project may be their \nbut-for cause\u2014but if one thing is clear in this context, \n\n39 \nit is that but-for cause is not enough.  The D.C. Circuit \nignored that critical limitation here.4 \nIndeed, the decision below ended up light-years \naway from any recognizable notion of proximate cause.  \nAccording to the court, the \u201cforeseeable environmental \neffects of the project\u201d include \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at new \noil wells that do not yet exist, but that may (or may not) \nbe constructed if the project is approved and it \nincreases demand for waxy crude from the Uinta \nBasin.  Pet.App.66a.  It would be a stretch to argue \nthat 88 miles of rail is the proximate cause of the \nextraction of any fuel, given the myriad factors that go \ninto energy extraction (market demands, emergence of \nnew technology, business expansion and contraction, \njust to name a few).  It would take proximate causation \nwell past its breaking point to try to connect the new \nrail with \u201cthe combustion\u201d of said fuel.  Yet the D.C. \nCircuit went further still, asserting that the new rail \nis the proximate cause of the climate effects of such \ncombustion.  That \u201csounds absurd, because it is.\u201d  \nSekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 738 (2013). \n3. The problems with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nrun deeper still.  NEPA requires consideration only of \n \n4 The regulations in effect at the relevant time here defined \n\u201ceffects\u201d to include both direct and indirect effects, with the latter \nencompassing effects \u201clater in time or farther removed in \ndistance\u201d than the former.  40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.8(a)-(b) (2019).  But \n\u201ceffects\u201d still must be effects of the project itself\u2014and even the \nindirect effects must \u201cstill [be] reasonably foreseeable,\u201d id. \n\u00a71508.8(b), i.e., proximately related to the agency action and \nproject at issue.  To the extent the courts of appeals have \ninterpreted the phrase \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d more broadly, \nthey have misapplied this Court\u2019s decisions. \n\n40 \nproximate effects of proposed projects on the physical \nenvironment, i.e., \u201cthe air, land and water.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772-73 (emphasis removed).  \u201cIf a \nharm does not have a sufficiently close connection to \nthe physical environment, NEPA does not apply.\u201d  Id. \nat 778.  Put simply, what matters is a project\u2019s \nproximate environmental effects; non-environmental \neffects, even if proximate, need not be considered.  The \ndecision \nbelow \ncannot \nbe \nsquared \nwith \nthat \nfundamental limitation on NEPA review. \nTake the risk of downline train accidents.  Even \nassuming that a new, 88-mile railway in rural Utah \nmight be the but-for cause of additional traffic on rail \nlines hundreds of miles distant, which in turn might \neventually contribute to an accident that would not \nhave occurred if the Uinta Basin remained cut off from \nthe national rail system, it does not follow that the \naccident would have any meaningful impact on the \n\u201cair, land and water.\u201d  If the train cars were unloaded \nor carrying innocuous cargo, there would be a safety \nrisk for the Federal Railway Administration to \nconsider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.  \n\u201cNEPA does not require the agency to assess every \nimpact or effect of its proposed action, but only the \nimpact or effect on the environment.\u201d  Id. at 772. \nAt most, then, the D.C. Circuit could only have \nrequired STB to reconsider (the vanishingly narrow \nand remote universe of) downline accidents actually \naffecting the physical environment.  But even limiting \nthe remand to train accidents actually impacting the \nphysical environment does not solve the problem; it \njust highlights that the decision below forces STB to \n\n41 \nevaluate \u201crisk, qua risk.\u201d  See id. at 779.  NEPA \nrequires STB \u201cto prepare an EIS evaluating\u201d harms \nthat are \u201cproximately related to a change in the \nphysical environment.\u201d  Id. at 774.  But the only \nreasonably foreseeable effect of connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the broader national rail system is that \nthere likely will be a very small number of new \naccidents.  That is not an environmental effect at all. \n* * * \nAll told, this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents make clear \nthat the metes and bounds of what an agency must \nanalyze under NEPA should be cabined by what is \nnecessary for the statute to fulfill its important, but \nlimited, mission:  \u201cto promote human welfare by \nalerting governmental actors to the effect of their \nproposed actions on the physical environment.\u201d  Metro. \nEdison, 460 U.S. at 772.  That makes this case \nstraightforward.  To the extent the proposed project \nhas actual environmental effects that are reasonably \nforeseeable consequences of the project itself, those \neffects must be analyzed (and, as explained, they were \nand then some).  But to the extent the project has non-\nenvironmental effects\u2014ranging from spurring new \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin, to (an infinitesimally \nsmall number of) increased rail accidents downline, to \na change in the quantity or mix of refining activities \non the Gulf Coast\u2014the risk of some environmental \nharm from those activities need not be considered \nunder NEPA.  Thus, in concrete terms, since \napproving the track could cross a critical habitat, \ncontribute to air pollution in the Uinta Basin, or \nchange the topography in a way that causes run-off to \nenter a mountain lake, STB properly studied these \n\n42 \nadverse effects of the project, relying as necessary on \ninput from other agencies, reasonable forecasting, and \neducated assumptions.  But it just as properly \ndeclined to go further to consider risks beyond the \neffect of the proposed action \u201con the physical \nenvironment.\u201d  See id. \nNo one\u2014save, perhaps, project opponents who \nbenefit from delay\u2014would be served by a system \n\u201crequir[ing] detailed discussion of \u2026 effects [that] \ncannot be readily ascertained\u201d in a way that is \n\u201c[in]compatible with the time-frame of the needs to \nwhich the underlying proposal is addressed.\u201d  Vt. \nYankee, 435 U.S. at 551.  And even if agencies did turn \nover every speculative rock (although there is always \nthe possibility of studying the next-most remote and \nspeculative risk), the resulting EISs would skew \ndecisionmaking by overemphasizing \u201csmall, often \nirrelevant, losses from the proposed new projects,\u201d and \nallowing them to distract from \u201cthe gains [in] \nenvironmental innovation.\u201d  Richard A. Epstein, The \nMany Sins of NEPA, 6 Tex. A&M L. Rev. 1, 3 (2018). \nIn short, \u201c[t]he scope of the agency\u2019s inquiries \nmust remain manageable if NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018ensur[ing] \na fully informed and well considered decision\u2019 is to be \naccomplished.\u201d  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. \nat 558).  The decision below defies that imperative. \nB. The Decision Below Flouts NEPA\u2019s Rule \nof Reason. \nAs the preceding section explains, the lack of \nproximate cause and actual environmental effects \nfrom the project suffice to explain why STB did not \nneed to consider the three \u201comissions\u201d identified by the \n\n43 \nD.C Circuit.  But STB actually did exercise its \ndiscretion to consider some of these issues in its EIS.  \nFor example, STB used models to predict how many \ntrains would be added to other rail lines, as well as \n\u201cnational data for train accident rates\u201d to predict \nmarginal \nrisks \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \ntrains.  \nPet.App.40a.  The Board likewise employed maps of \nwildfire potential to conclude that the risk of downline \nfires was miniscule.  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s real gripe was not that these effects went \nunstudied, but rather that the court felt that STB \nshould have gone further in its studies.  That is a rule \nof bottomless process, not a rule of reason\u2014and it \ndefies this Court\u2019s precedents.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas, 462 U.S. at 103 (\u201cA reviewing court should not \nmagnify a single line item beyond its significance as \nonly part of a larger Table.\u201d). \nIndeed, when it came to the environmental effects \non communities on the Gulf Coast, the D.C. Circuit \nwent even further and effectively punished STB for \ngoing beyond what NEPA requires.  Given that any \nenvironmental effect on Gulf Coast communities is \nremote and speculative, STB could have simply \ndismissed any such effect as hopelessly remote.  Cf. \nMetro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 (rejecting any need to \nconsider psychological effects on far-flung relatives of \nlocal residents).  But STB nonetheless went beyond \nthe call of legal duty to try to trace potential increases \nin waxy crude production to refineries on the Gulf \nCoast, while disclaiming any ability to identify \nparticular refineries.  Applying the no-good-deed-goes-\nunpunished rule of Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat by tracing the waxy crude to Gulf Coast \nrefineries, STB obligated itself to go further and study \n\n44 \nenvironmental effects on Gulf Coast communities and \nthe \nrefineries \ncontribution \nto \nclimate \nchange.  \nPet.App.34a-35a. \nThat approach gets matters almost exactly \nbackwards and defies this Court\u2019s direction to apply a \n\u201cpractical rule of reason\u201d to agency determinations \nand go no further in studying increasingly remote \nenvironmental effects.  Once an EIS analyzes a \nproject\u2019s proximate environmental effects, there is no \nvalid basis for a court to demand more.  The agency \ncan choose to go further, if time and resources allow.  \nBut the agency should not be faulted, let alone \nreversed, for going beyond what is legally required.  \nAnd if the agency concludes that investing additional \nbandwidth into studying a distant or speculative \nenvironmental effect is unlikely to be helpful, then a \ncourt has no \u201cmeaningful standard[]\u201d with which to \nsecond-guess the agency\u2019s judgment.  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 679-80 (2023).  \u201cTo require \notherwise would render agency decisionmaking \nintractable.\u201d  Marsh, 490 U.S. at 373. \nAn agency can deem further study unhelpful for \nany number of reasons.  As in Public Citizen, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when the \nagency lacks the legal \u201cability to prevent\u201d  the studied \neffect.  541 U.S. at 770.  Or, as in Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency might deem further study unhelpful when \nthe agency lacks subject-matter expertise to evaluate \nthe effect:  \u201cTime and resources are simply too \nlimited \u2026 to believe that Congress intended to\u201d \n\u201coblige[]\u201d agencies \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping \u2026 expertise that is not otherwise relevant \nto their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  460 U.S. \n\n45 \nat 776; see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n729 (2022) (\u201c\u2018When [an] agency has no comparative \nexpertise\u2019 in making certain policy judgments \u2026 \n\u2018Congress presumably would not\u2019 task it with doing \nso.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Kisor v. Wilkie, \n588 U.S. 558, 578 (2019))).  Or, as in Robertson, an \nagency might deem further study unhelpful when \nanother regulator has primary responsibility for \nremediating \nthe \nstudied \neffect \nin \na \nmore \ncomprehensive fashion.  See 490 U.S. at 340; p.24, \nsupra. \nThese sensible principles laid down by this Court \nexplain why STB was well within its prerogative to \ndecline further study of downline accidents, Gulf \nCoast communities, or \u201cthe climate effects of the \ncombustion of the fuel intended to be extracted\u201d at yet-\nto-be-built oil wells that may be constructed as a result \nof the new rail.  Pet.App.66a.  At the end of the day, \nSTB is not in a position to regulate rail traffic, track \nsafety, refinery practices, or climate change.  Cf. \nJames W. Coleman, Beyond the Pipeline Wars: \nReforming Environmental Assessment of Energy \nTransport Infrastructure, 2018 Utah L. Rev. 119, 143 \n(2018) (\u201cIn practice, in unpredictably changing energy \nmarkets, it is nearly impossible to predict the \nupstream and downstream impact of a new pipeline \nproject.\u201d).  More to the point, regulation of those issues \nshould focus on ensuring the optimal rules for all track \nsafety and all refinery emissions, not obsessing about \nthe marginal contributions of 88 miles of new track in \nremote, rural Utah.   \nTo be sure, NEPA calls for inter-agency \nconsultation.  But that consultation should be brought \n\n46 \nto bear only on the problems that the proponent \nagency is supposed to study under NEPA.  There is a \nvast difference between consulting with the Forest \nService to determine the effects of a proposed rail \nroute that passes through a National Forest, see, e.g., \nPet.App.182a, and asking EPA to assess how 88 miles \nof additional track in Utah will contribute to climate \nchange based on refining activities on the Gulf Coast.  \nNEPA may require the former, but the rule of reason \nprotects an agency that declines to do the latter. \nThe same logic applies for STB\u2019s reasonable \ndecision to study potential ecological harms from the \nrailway, \nbut \nnot \npotential \nharms \nfrom \nnew \nconstruction that the new line may precipitate.  The \nextent to which one infrastructure project will spur \nsubsequent development is hard enough to predict for \nexperts in real estate or urban planning\u2014and STB is \nneither of those things.  And that is doubly true given \nthat, as even the D.C. Circuit admitted, there is \npresently no way to know with any reasonable degree \nof certainty where exactly in the 12,000-square-mile \nUinta Basin this new development will end up or how \nextensive it will be (if it ends up being built at all).  See \nPet.App.31a-34a. \n \nTo \nthe \nextent \nsome \nnew \ndevelopment materializes, there will be time enough \nfor the appropriate state or federal agencies to perform \ntheir respective statutory mandates to evaluate the \nenvironmental effects of a concrete proposal.  There is \nno need to burden a different agency now with an \nentirely predictive and potentially unnecessary \nhypothetical EIS.   \nSo too for train accidents.  As noted, STB did look \ninto the risks of increased accidents downline, but it \n\n47 \nstopped its NEPA review of the potential risks of \nadditional accidents the new railway could pose after \nconcluding that the risks were de minimis.  See pp.12-\n13, supra.  That is an eminently reasonable approach.  \nRail traffic safety is not a purely (or even \npredominantly) environmental issue.  While train \naccidents, like tanker-truck accidents, have the \npotential to cause environmental problems, the \nprincipal regulatory goal is to minimize all accidents \non the rails, whether cars are full or empty, or whether \nthey carry passengers, wheat, or waxy crude.  And, \nmore to the point, there is a federal agency with \nexpertise, authority, and responsibility for rail safety, \nand it is not STB, but the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (\u201cFRA\u201d), whose Administrator must \nhave \u201cprofessional experience in railroad safety, \nhazardous materials safety, or other transportation \nsafety.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \u00a7103(d); see p.10, supra.  If \nrespondents think FRA is falling down in its \nmanagement of the national rail system, that is a \nproblem whether or not there are 88 miles of \nadditional track in rural Utah, and they should \nchallenge the relevant FRA agency action.  What they \nshould not be allowed to do is tie the Uinta Basin \nRailway up in court indefinitely by bringing a NEPA \nclaim against STB concerning a de minimis risk. \nThat is especially true given STB\u2019s role in \nadministering a statute that puts a thumb on the scale \nin favor of rail construction.  STB is the successor \nagency to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Its \nmembers must have expertise in transportation and \nbusiness, not oil refining, ecology, or even train safety.  \nIts fundamental duty under 49 U.S.C. \u00a710901 is \n\u201cauthoriz[ing]\u201d rail line \u201cactivities \u2026 []consistent with \n\n48 \nthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d  Id. \u00a710901(c).  \nNeedless to say, any project that contributes to \ninterstate commerce could also be said to contribute to \nclimate change or increased traffic on the national \nrailway system.  While agencies can certainly study \nthe \nenvironmental \nrisks \nfrom \nsuch \nincreased \ncommercial activity, the rule of reason places \nreasonable limits on how much study is necessary and \nprevents NEPA from working at cross-purposes with \nthe basic pro-development mission of agencies like \nSTB. \nAs the decision below illustrates, however, the \nD.C. Circuit has replaced this Court\u2019s rule of reason \nwith a mandate to consider everything under the Sun.  \nIf an agency can block a project on the ground that it \n\u201cwould be too harmful to the environment,\u201d then (says \nthe D.C. Circuit) the agency must consider any and all \ndistant environmental effects the project may (or may \nnot) engender\u2014even if the agency has no role in \nregulating those effects, or the conditions that may \nmitigate or exacerbate them.  Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at \n1373.  So, here, the fact that STB can \u201cdeny\u201d the \npermit required for the rail project \u201con the ground that \nthe railway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other \ncosts outweigh its expected benefits\u201d meant that it \nmust consider \u201cthe climate effects of the combustion of \nthe fuel intended to be extracted\u201d\u2014even though STB \nhas zero authority to do anything about oil extraction, \nfuel combustion, or climate effects.  Pet.App.36a-37a, \n66a.  That is not a rule of reason; it is the opposite. \nThis Court long ago cautioned that NEPA \u201cshould \nnot be\u201d turned into \u201ca game\u201d in which environmental \ngroups and other opponents of progress \u201cengage in \n\n49 \nunjustified obstructionism\u201d by raising a laundry list of \nfar-flung effects that, in their view, \u201c\u2018ought to be\u2019 \nconsidered,\u201d no matter how long it takes and no matter \nwhether the agency doing the considering has any \npower to do anything about the supposed problems the \nproject poses.  Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 553-54.  The \nCourt doubled down on that view in Metropolitan \nEdison, emphasizing that policy disagreements should \nbe aired in \u201c[t]he political process, and not NEPA\u201d \nlitigation.  460 U.S. at 777.  It bears emphasis that \nNEPA applies equally to legislative proposals and \nagency projects, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(2)(C), and yet \nlegislative proposals do not come encumbered with \n3,600-page EISs.  The explanation for that difference \nlies in the felt-need of agencies to paper the record in \nthe context of projects that can be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Congress recently made its views on the \npotential misuses and excesses of NEPA crystal clear.  \nSee Part I.B., supra.  Yet, as the decision below makes \nall too clear, the home court of appeals for most of the \nfederal alphabet soup agencies has not gotten the \nmessage.  This Court should set the record straight, \nreverse the decision below, and unshackle agencies \nand infrastructure-development projects from NEPA-\nlitigation purgatory. \nIII. The Court Should Confirm That STB\u2019s EIS \nSatisfies NEPA\u2019s Requirements. \nThis is hardly a case of an agency that \ngreenlighted \na \nproject \nheedless \nof \npotential \nenvironmental impacts.  The EIS here runs to 3,600 \npages.  It took years to prepare, and it reflects \nconsultation with sister agencies with expertise in \nparticular areas.  But all that was not remotely good \n\n50 \nenough for the D.C. Circuit, which demanded more \nspeculation and more exhaustive consideration of \nenvironmental (and non-environmental) risks that are \nremote in both time and geography and that implicate \nissues far outside STB\u2019s narrowly focused mandate.  \nSuch an approach threatens a project that promises to \nbring significant economic development to the Uinta \nBasin by connecting that remote area with the \nnational economy.   \nAnd the threat does not end there.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment demands investment, and investors \ndemand a degree of certainty and assurance that they \nwill not become victims of a regulatory rope-a-dope.  \nOpponents of development know full well that they do \nnot need to win every legal battle to prevail in the war \nof attrition.  The decision below is thus a threat not \njust \nto \nthe \npromising \nproject \nhere, \nbut \nto \ninfrastructure development in general. \nThe best way for this Court to send a clear signal \nthat such NEPA abuse will not be tolerated is to \naffirmatively hold that STB\u2019s EIS here passes NEPA \nmuster.  As the preceding discussion reveals, STB\u2019s \nEIS was comprehensive and thoroughgoing.  It readily \ncleared NEPA\u2019s minimum requirements, since it \nstudied all effects on the physical environment \nproximately caused by approving the railroad.  It even \nwent past proximate cause and discussed some remote \neffects and marginal risks like train accidents and \ndown-rail fires.  But that was gravy, not grounds for \nvacatur and additional study.  Although the court of \nappeals may have preferred that discussion to be more \nthorough, that is not the test.  There is no basis for \nreversing a favorable NEPA determination that \n\n51 \nconsiders all of the proximate environmental effects of \nthe proposed project, and the rule of reason protects \nagencies when they go further and consider some \nmarginal risks without exhaustively examining them \nor running down every rabbit hole.  Simply put, absent \na failure to consider an effect that is both proximate \nand environmental, 3,600 pages of EIS ought to be \nmore than enough. \nIn these circumstances, remanding the EIS to the \nagency \nwould \naccomplish \nnothing \nbut \nsowing \nadditional confusion and delay.  To give both \npetitioners and the people of the Uinta Basin the \ncertainty that they deserve, the Court should reverse \nwith language making clear that STB has no \nobligation to revisit its EIS on remand. \n\n52 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJAY C.
