    "facts_of_the_case": "In 1998, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for his involvement in the robbery and killing of Escolastica Harrison. After multiple appeals and habeas corpus petitions, Gutierrez sought DNA testing of evidence from the crime scene under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 64. Texas courts repeatedly denied his requests, in part because Chapter 64 does not authorize testing when exculpatory results might only affect punishment or sentencing.\n\nIn 2019, Gutierrez filed a federal lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz and others challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 improperly limited the rights granted in another Texas statute (Article 11.071) governing successive habeas applications for death row inmates. The district court agreed, ruling that the interaction between these laws violated procedural due process by making the right to bring a successive habeas application to claim innocence of the death penalty \u201cillusory.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim and vacated the district court\u2019s judgment.",

This moves beyond the general facts into the specific legal reasoning the Court will evaluate.

Saenz; Felix Sauceda, Chief, Brownsville Police Department,  \n \nDefendants\u2014Appellants. \n______________________________ \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court  \nfor the Southern District of Texas \nUSDC No. 1:19-CV-185 \n______________________________\nBefore Southwick, Haynes, and Higginson, Circuit Judges. \nLeslie H. Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n28: 20240625164206282_24-06-25_Appendix.json (score: 0.630)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNo. _____ \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n29: 20240625164131272_24-06-25_CertPetition.json (score: 0.623)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNo. _____ \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Saenz; Felix Sauceda, Chief, Brownsville Police Department,  \n \nDefendants\u2014Appellants. \n______________________________ \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court  \nfor the Southern District of Texas \nUSDC No. 1:19-CV-185 \n______________________________\nBefore Southwick, Haynes, and Higginson, Circuit Judges. \nLeslie H. Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s highest \ncriminal court has already held should be the effect of such a decision. \nThe final step before adopting the proposed distinction is to see if it \nactually distinguishes Reed.  We start with what Reed argued at the Supreme \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA12\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n12 \nCourt.  \u201cAmong other things, Reed argued that the law\u2019s stringent chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional and in effect foreclosed DNA \ntesting for individuals convicted before \u2018rules governing the State\u2019s handling \nand storage of evidence were put in place.\u2019\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 233 (quoting \nJoint Appendix at 39, Reed, 598 U.S. 230 (No. 21-442)).3  \nIf Reed is to be distinguished from the case, we need to determine if \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations \nviolated federal law, that Reed\u2019s claim would still fail.  That court certainly \ngave lengthy consideration to Reed\u2019s effort to acquire DNA testing of certain \nevidence.  See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 764\u201380 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).  \nThe court held that numerous items were not available for DNA testing \nbecause the chain of custody for them was broken.  Id. at 770.  The court did \nnot discuss the constitutionality of the state\u2019s chain-of-custody requirements \nor whether Reed would gain the testing if they violated a federal right.4    \n_____________________ \n3 It gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining \nthe state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.  That \ncould mean, implicitly, that the state court opinion was irrelevant.  Instead, perhaps this \nprinciple applies: \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the \nattention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. \n507, 511 (1925)).  We examined the Reed briefs at the Supreme Court; none argued that \nsome holding in the state court opinion would affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.   \nWe adopt the \u201clurk in the record\u201d option and consider the distinction viable.  As \nwe discuss, one good reason for silence in the briefs and in the Supreme Court opinion is \nthat the Court of Criminal Appeals made no similar pronouncement in its Reed decision. \n4 The initial briefs submitted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Reed did \nnot allege unconstitutionality in the chain-of-custody requirements.  Understandably, then, \nthe state court\u2019s opinion did not discuss, as the Gutierrez opinion did, whether DNA testing \nwould be justified even if the relevant requirements were unconstitutional.  Reed first \nraised a constitutional argument about chain of custody in his motion for rehearing.  The \nstate court denied rehearing without an opinion.  See Order Denying Rehearing, Reed, 541 \nS.W.3d 759 (No. AP\u201377,054), available at https://search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?cn=AP-\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA13\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n13 \nConsidering this background, what is the federal issue that could be \nresolved in this Section 1983 suit that would have a likely effect on the \nprosecutor?  The Court of Criminal Appeals has already found that Gutierrez \nwould have no right to DNA testing even if the statutory bar to testing for \nevidence about sentencing were held to be unconstitutional.  The federal \ndistrict court found unconstitutionality, but according to the Court of \nCriminal Appeals, any new evidence \u201cwould not overcome the \noverwhelming evidence of his direct involvement in the multi-assailant \nmurder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  Gutierrez acknowledges he is not \nentitled to DNA testing for what amounts to mitigation evidence, i.e., \nevidence that might cause a reasonable juror to decide not to vote for the \ndeath penalty because, for example, he did not himself commit the murder.   \nThe following summarizes Gutierrez\u2019s argument as to what DNA \nevidence could prove: \nDNA evidence that identifies perpetrators but excludes Mr. \nGutierrez would establish that Mr. Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not \nparticipate in the murder.  This evidence thus would cast doubt \non whether Mr. Gutierrez \u201cactually caused the death of the \ndecedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that \na human life would be taken.\u201d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. \n37.071(b)(2).  \n \nGutierrez\u2019s disagreement with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 finding \nthat DNA evidence would not override the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of \nguilt of a capital crime is a factual disagreement about the potential effect of \nnew evidence on jurors.  This declaratory judgment action is a facial \n_____________________ \n77,054&coa=coscca.  Thus, the Texas court made no holding in Reed comparable to its \nholding in Gutierrez about potential invalidation of the challenged requirement. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA14\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n14 \nchallenge to Texas statutes.  It is not properly used to contest fact-findings \nby a state court in that court\u2019s prior denial of DNA testing.   \nReed is properly distinguished.  As to Gutierrez, the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals effectively anticipated an unfavorable federal court ruling.  \nThat court held, should the limitation on DNA testing for evidence relevant \nonly to conviction be invalid, the facts in the trial record would prevent \nGutierrez from receiving the DNA testing because such evidence could not \nchange the fact that he was death-eligible.  As a result, we conclude that a \nstate court, if presented with Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing, would be \nbound by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 holding that such testing \nwould be meaningless.  The Reed analysis that standing requires that a \nprosecutor be likely to grant access to the requested evidence should a \nfavorable federal court ruling be obtained cannot be satisfied on the facts of \nthis case. \nBecause there is not a substantial likelihood that a favorable ruling by \na federal court on Gutierrez\u2019s claims would cause the prosecutor to order \nDNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s claims are not redressable in this Section 1983 suit.  \nWe VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND to have the \ncomplaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA15\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n15 \nStephen A. Higginson, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nWith respect, I disagree that Ruben Gutierrez, a defendant facing ex-\necution, lacks standing to bring this suit.  \nI do not see a meaningful distinction from Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 \n(2023), where the Supreme Court held \u201ca prisoner had standing to pursue a \ndeclaratory judgment against a state prosecutor that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA testing law \u2018failed to provide procedural due process,\u2019\u201d Majority Op. \nat 7 (quoting in part Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). In the same context we face here, \nrelating to a capital defendant\u2019s challenge to Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, the Supreme Court clarified that if a federal court decides \nthat procedure violates due process, the decision \u201cwould have ordered a \nchange in a legal status [that] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evi-\ndence and that [the prisoner] therefore would obtain relief that directly re-\ndresses the injury suffered.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nLike Reed, Gutierrez filed suit against the appropriate local prosecu-\ntor and made a similar claim regarding Texas\u2019s DNA testing regime.  While \nI appreciate the majority\u2019s careful tracing of the state-court case history and \nfair inquiry into what the named state prosecutor might or might not do, I do \nnot perceive that the Supreme Court contemplated this nuance and distinc-\ntion.  Instead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what Dis-\ntrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a declar-\natory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure would signifi-\ncantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to \nthe requested DNA testing.  \nBecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also fac-\ning execution, has standing to bring suit.   \n \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA16\n\nState v.

Benjamin Euresti, Jr., Judge Presiding.\nON THIS DAY CAME TO BE CONSIDERED DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR DNA TESTING, and the Court, in reviewing\nthe applicable statutes governing the instant Motion, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01, et seq., Defendant's Motion, the State's\nResponse, and the court's entire record, finds that Defendant's prayer for relief cannot be favored, for the following reasons:\n1. Defendant's Motion fails to comply with Texas Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B). Defendant did have\nthe opportunity to inspect all physical evidence in the State's possession before trial began including those\nspecific items listed in his motion. There has been no complaint raised regarding ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel for any alleged failure to have an independent expert appointed, to have testing performed on\nany evidence, or to request a continuance prior to trial so these matters could be done. Trial counsel advised\nthis Court, prior to trial, that after reviewing the evidence it would make any such requests if it deemed\nnecessary. No such requests were made and no objections were lodged. Thus, fault is attributable to the\n\u201cconvicted person\u201d as to why the biological material was not previously subjected to DNA testing. This\nCourt finds that Defendant has failed to make a \u201cparticularized\u201d showing that the biological materials were\nnever tested through no fault of his own. Routier v. State, 273 S.W.3d 241,247 (Tex.Crim.App.2008).\n2. In reviewing State's response pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.02, the Court finds that DNA\nevidence, specifically the single loose hair described in Defendant's motion, does not exist because it was\nnever recovered as evidence in the investigation of the case and there is no record of a chain of custody\nfor the single loose hair. The Court finds that the non-existence of this piece of evidence was not caused\nby any bad faith of the State.\n3. Further, even if fault was not attributable to the Defendant concerning the remaining untested biological\nevidence listed in his motion, the Court finds the following:\na. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(1)(B), specifically\nthat identity was not and is not an issue in the case considering the entire record, to include the Defendant's statements, the Co-\ndefendants' statements to investigators, the testimony of an eyewitness connecting the Defendant to the murder scene.\nb. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(2)(A), specifically\nthe Defendant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been convicted if \u201cexculpatory\nresults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d\nA43\n\nState v.

Saenz; Felix Sauceda, Chief, Brownsville Police Department,  \n \nDefendants\u2014Appellants. \n______________________________ \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court  \nfor the Southern District of Texas \nUSDC No. 1:19-CV-185 \n______________________________\nBefore Southwick, Haynes, and Higginson, Circuit Judges. \nLeslie H. Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s highest \ncriminal court has already held should be the effect of such a decision. \nThe final step before adopting the proposed distinction is to see if it \nactually distinguishes Reed.  We start with what Reed argued at the Supreme \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA12\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n12 \nCourt.  \u201cAmong other things, Reed argued that the law\u2019s stringent chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional and in effect foreclosed DNA \ntesting for individuals convicted before \u2018rules governing the State\u2019s handling \nand storage of evidence were put in place.\u2019\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 233 (quoting \nJoint Appendix at 39, Reed, 598 U.S. 230 (No. 21-442)).3  \nIf Reed is to be distinguished from the case, we need to determine if \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations \nviolated federal law, that Reed\u2019s claim would still fail.  That court certainly \ngave lengthy consideration to Reed\u2019s effort to acquire DNA testing of certain \nevidence.  See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 764\u201380 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).  \nThe court held that numerous items were not available for DNA testing \nbecause the chain of custody for them was broken.  Id. at 770.  The court did \nnot discuss the constitutionality of the state\u2019s chain-of-custody requirements \nor whether Reed would gain the testing if they violated a federal right.4    \n_____________________ \n3 It gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining \nthe state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.  That \ncould mean, implicitly, that the state court opinion was irrelevant.  Instead, perhaps this \nprinciple applies: \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the \nattention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. \n507, 511 (1925)).  We examined the Reed briefs at the Supreme Court; none argued that \nsome holding in the state court opinion would affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.   \nWe adopt the \u201clurk in the record\u201d option and consider the distinction viable.  As \nwe discuss, one good reason for silence in the briefs and in the Supreme Court opinion is \nthat the Court of Criminal Appeals made no similar pronouncement in its Reed decision. \n4 The initial briefs submitted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Reed did \nnot allege unconstitutionality in the chain-of-custody requirements.  Understandably, then, \nthe state court\u2019s opinion did not discuss, as the Gutierrez opinion did, whether DNA testing \nwould be justified even if the relevant requirements were unconstitutional.  Reed first \nraised a constitutional argument about chain of custody in his motion for rehearing.  The \nstate court denied rehearing without an opinion.  See Order Denying Rehearing, Reed, 541 \nS.W.3d 759 (No. AP\u201377,054), available at https://search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?cn=AP-\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA13\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n13 \nConsidering this background, what is the federal issue that could be \nresolved in this Section 1983 suit that would have a likely effect on the \nprosecutor?  The Court of Criminal Appeals has already found that Gutierrez \nwould have no right to DNA testing even if the statutory bar to testing for \nevidence about sentencing were held to be unconstitutional.  The federal \ndistrict court found unconstitutionality, but according to the Court of \nCriminal Appeals, any new evidence \u201cwould not overcome the \noverwhelming evidence of his direct involvement in the multi-assailant \nmurder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  Gutierrez acknowledges he is not \nentitled to DNA testing for what amounts to mitigation evidence, i.e., \nevidence that might cause a reasonable juror to decide not to vote for the \ndeath penalty because, for example, he did not himself commit the murder.   \nThe following summarizes Gutierrez\u2019s argument as to what DNA \nevidence could prove: \nDNA evidence that identifies perpetrators but excludes Mr. \nGutierrez would establish that Mr. Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not \nparticipate in the murder.  This evidence thus would cast doubt \non whether Mr. Gutierrez \u201cactually caused the death of the \ndecedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that \na human life would be taken.\u201d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. \n37.071(b)(2).  \n \nGutierrez\u2019s disagreement with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 finding \nthat DNA evidence would not override the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of \nguilt of a capital crime is a factual disagreement about the potential effect of \nnew evidence on jurors.  This declaratory judgment action is a facial \n_____________________ \n77,054&coa=coscca.  Thus, the Texas court made no holding in Reed comparable to its \nholding in Gutierrez about potential invalidation of the challenged requirement. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA14\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n14 \nchallenge to Texas statutes.  It is not properly used to contest fact-findings \nby a state court in that court\u2019s prior denial of DNA testing.   \nReed is properly distinguished.  As to Gutierrez, the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals effectively anticipated an unfavorable federal court ruling.  \nThat court held, should the limitation on DNA testing for evidence relevant \nonly to conviction be invalid, the facts in the trial record would prevent \nGutierrez from receiving the DNA testing because such evidence could not \nchange the fact that he was death-eligible.  As a result, we conclude that a \nstate court, if presented with Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing, would be \nbound by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 holding that such testing \nwould be meaningless.  The Reed analysis that standing requires that a \nprosecutor be likely to grant access to the requested evidence should a \nfavorable federal court ruling be obtained cannot be satisfied on the facts of \nthis case. \nBecause there is not a substantial likelihood that a favorable ruling by \na federal court on Gutierrez\u2019s claims would cause the prosecutor to order \nDNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s claims are not redressable in this Section 1983 suit.  \nWe VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND to have the \ncomplaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA15\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n15 \nStephen A. Higginson, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nWith respect, I disagree that Ruben Gutierrez, a defendant facing ex-\necution, lacks standing to bring this suit.  \nI do not see a meaningful distinction from Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 \n(2023), where the Supreme Court held \u201ca prisoner had standing to pursue a \ndeclaratory judgment against a state prosecutor that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA testing law \u2018failed to provide procedural due process,\u2019\u201d Majority Op. \nat 7 (quoting in part Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). In the same context we face here, \nrelating to a capital defendant\u2019s challenge to Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, the Supreme Court clarified that if a federal court decides \nthat procedure violates due process, the decision \u201cwould have ordered a \nchange in a legal status [that] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evi-\ndence and that [the prisoner] therefore would obtain relief that directly re-\ndresses the injury suffered.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nLike Reed, Gutierrez filed suit against the appropriate local prosecu-\ntor and made a similar claim regarding Texas\u2019s DNA testing regime.  While \nI appreciate the majority\u2019s careful tracing of the state-court case history and \nfair inquiry into what the named state prosecutor might or might not do, I do \nnot perceive that the Supreme Court contemplated this nuance and distinc-\ntion.  Instead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what Dis-\ntrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a declar-\natory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure would signifi-\ncantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to \nthe requested DNA testing.  \nBecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also fac-\ning execution, has standing to bring suit.   \n \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA16\n\nState v.

Benjamin Euresti, Jr., Judge Presiding.\nON THIS DAY CAME TO BE CONSIDERED DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR DNA TESTING, and the Court, in reviewing\nthe applicable statutes governing the instant Motion, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01, et seq., Defendant's Motion, the State's\nResponse, and the court's entire record, finds that Defendant's prayer for relief cannot be favored, for the following reasons:\n1. Defendant's Motion fails to comply with Texas Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B). Defendant did have\nthe opportunity to inspect all physical evidence in the State's possession before trial began including those\nspecific items listed in his motion. There has been no complaint raised regarding ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel for any alleged failure to have an independent expert appointed, to have testing performed on\nany evidence, or to request a continuance prior to trial so these matters could be done. Trial counsel advised\nthis Court, prior to trial, that after reviewing the evidence it would make any such requests if it deemed\nnecessary. No such requests were made and no objections were lodged. Thus, fault is attributable to the\n\u201cconvicted person\u201d as to why the biological material was not previously subjected to DNA testing. This\nCourt finds that Defendant has failed to make a \u201cparticularized\u201d showing that the biological materials were\nnever tested through no fault of his own. Routier v. State, 273 S.W.3d 241,247 (Tex.Crim.App.2008).\n2. In reviewing State's response pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.02, the Court finds that DNA\nevidence, specifically the single loose hair described in Defendant's motion, does not exist because it was\nnever recovered as evidence in the investigation of the case and there is no record of a chain of custody\nfor the single loose hair. The Court finds that the non-existence of this piece of evidence was not caused\nby any bad faith of the State.\n3. Further, even if fault was not attributable to the Defendant concerning the remaining untested biological\nevidence listed in his motion, the Court finds the following:\na. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(1)(B), specifically\nthat identity was not and is not an issue in the case considering the entire record, to include the Defendant's statements, the Co-\ndefendants' statements to investigators, the testimony of an eyewitness connecting the Defendant to the murder scene.\nb. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(2)(A), specifically\nthe Defendant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been convicted if \u201cexculpatory\nresults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d\nA43\n\nState v.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed.

Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). \nThe question presented is: \n \nDoes Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a \nspecific state official will redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by following a favorable \ndeclaratory judgment? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS IN LOWER FEDERAL COURTS \n \nSouthern District of Texas, Gutierrez v.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024 WL 2964140 (U.S. June 13, 2024), and \nReed, 598 U.S. 230.  \nI. \nTHE DECISION BELOW CREATES A CIRCUIT SPLIT BY \nREOPENING A QUESTON THAT THIS COURT SOUGHT TO \nSETTLE IN REED. \nCertiorari review is crucial when courts of appeals disagree about an area of \nfederal law. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a); see also Reed, 598 U.S.at 234 (certiorari granted to \nresolve circuit split regarding \u201cwhen the statute of limitations begins to run for a \n\u00a7 1983 suit regarding a State\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures\u201d). The need to \nresolve the circuit split in this case is particularly important because this Court had \nalready settled the precise standing issue before the Fifth Circuit, yet the Fifth \nCircuit opinion conflicts with that holding and creates an awkward new rule for \nstanding, requiring a pre-jurisdictional mini-trial to forecast the conduct of state \nofficials in response to a not-yet-issued declaratory judgment. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).  \nThe Fifth Circuit panel majority\u2019s rewriting of this Court\u2019s clearly established \nlaw should be addressed before additional circuit courts of appeals are faced with \ncases brought by plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions seeking declaratory judgments, and cases \nlooking to apply Reed\u2019s standing analysis generally.  \n\n \n12 \n \nA. \nThe Eighth Circuit \nThe majority\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 \n(8th Cir. 2023). Johnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in \nthe context of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional because it violates due process. Johnson, like Reed and Gutierrez, is \non death row, and sued the prosecuting attorney in his Arkansas county pursuant to \na \u00a7 1983 action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the State\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting statute violated due process. \nThe Eighth Circuit held that Johnson had standing under circumstances that \nare all but identical to those here. After recognizing the defendant\u2019s argument that \nstanding was not specifically addressed in either Osborne or Skinner, the Eighth \nCircuit stated: \u201c[A]ny lingering doubt about a prisoner\u2019s standing to bring the distinct \nprocedural due process claim recognized by those two cases was dispelled by the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Reed v. Goertz.\u201d Johnson, 69 F.4th at 511. The \nEighth Circuit held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s injury is redressable because, as explained in \nReed, \u2018if a federal court concludes [Arkansas\u2019s] post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate\u2019 the Prosecuting \nAttorney\u2019s \u2018justification for denying DNA testing.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority\u2019s reasoning, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nfinding of standing was unaffected by the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s prior holding in \nJohnson\u2019s motion for DNA testing that Arkansas\u2019s statute allows DNA testing only if \nit will \u201csignificantly advance\u201d the prisoner\u2019s claim of innocence, and that \u201cnone of the \nevidence that might result from the proposed testing could advance Johnson\u2019s claim \n\n \n13 \n \nof actual innocence.\u201d Id. at 508 (quoting state court decision). The Eighth Circuit, like \nJudge Higginson, simply followed Reed and applied it to the legal posture of the case. \nB. \nThe Ninth Circuit \nThe ruling below also contravenes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of Reed. In \nRedd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), Redd filed a \u00a7 1983 action against \njudges in the state court system, alleging that California\u2019s system of appointing \ncounsel violated his due process rights. \u201c[T]he State Officers contended that Redd \nlacks standing because his injury is not redressable by a decision in its favor.\u201d Id. at \n884. The Ninth Circuit concluded: \u201cOnce a court issues a declaratory judgment, that \norder effectuates a change in the legal status between the parties such that \u2018the \npractical consequences of that change would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the plaintiff \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Reed, 598 U.S. at 234 (additional internal quotations omitted)).  \nThe Ninth Circuit did not stop there:   \nIn Reed, for example, a Texas prisoner filed a section 1983 action \nclaiming the state\u2019s postconviction DNA procedures violated procedural \ndue process. . . . The \u201conly relief\u201d sought was \u201ca declaration that the \n[state court\u2019s] interpretation and application of state law was \nunconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment \nagainst the state prosecutor would redress that state\u2019s denial of DNA \ntesting. The declaration sought \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing\u201d and make it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d \nthat the state prosecutor would abide by the court\u2019s decision. \n \nId. (quoting Reed, 598 at 234) (additional internal quotations omitted). The Ninth \nCircuit thus did not undertake an individualized standing analysis to predict whether \nthe state defendants would actually give Redd the relief he sought if he prevailed in \nfederal court. The court instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was \n\n \n14 \n \nsimilarly situated to Reed\u2014exactly as the Eighth Circuit did in Johnson and as Judge \nHigginson did in his dissent here. \nII. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION CONTRADICTS THIS COURT\u2019S \nDECISION IN REED. \nBoth Ruben Gutierrez and Rodney Reed sit on death row in Texas. Both men \npetitioned their respective Texas district courts for post-conviction DNA testing \npursuant to Chapter 64, and both men were denied testing. Both men appealed to the \nCCA, and the CCA affirmed in both cases. The CCA told both men that, even if they \ngot the DNA testing they wanted, they would still ultimately be unable to obtain the \nrelief they sought. See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); \nA79. \nBoth men filed \u00a7 1983 lawsuits in federal district court seeking declaratory \njudgments that Texas\u2019s Chapter 64 violates their due process rights. Reed argued \nthat Chapter 64 violates his due process rights because the chain-of-custody \nrequirements were too demanding. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 violates his due \nprocess rights because he could not move for testing to show he was innocent of the \ndeath penalty, despite a clear right to file a subsequent habeas petition on that \nground under Texas Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3). Both men named the local District \nAttorneys as defendants. Both District Attorneys opposed DNA testing and continue \nto oppose DNA testing.  \nBoth men were found by the district courts to have Article III standing. \nGutierrez prevailed in district court and obtained a declaratory judgment in his favor. \nA42. The district court in Reed\u2019s case dismissed his \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\n \n15 \n \nfor failing to establish Chapter 64 violated due process. Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-\n0794-LY, 2019 WL 12073901, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). The losing parties in \nboth cases appealed to the Fifth Circuit.  \nHere, the men\u2019s paths diverged. The Fifth Circuit did not question that Reed \nhad standing to bring his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit but found the action untimely. Reed v. \nGoertz, 995 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2021). On certiorari review, this Court rejected Texas\u2019s \nargument that Reed lacked standing and instead ruled that a favorable federal \njudgment \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting\u201d and create a substantial likelihood of compliance by the State. Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234. This Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s timeliness ruling and remanded \nfor further proceedings. Id. at 237.  \nIn Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit grafted onto \nReed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the opposite result. The \nmajority scoured the state court record, including briefing by the parties, and \nspeculated that, in this case, state officials would not permit DNA testing even in the \nface of a federal court judgment because, in earlier proceedings, the CCA commented \nthat favorable DNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the \nredressability prong of Article III standing.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well beyond the analysis this Court \nestablished in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not \nmention examining the state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the \n\n \n16 \n \nprosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3. The majority justified its departure from \nReed based on the principle that \u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having \nbeen so decided.\u201d Id. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). The majority opined, in \nother words, that this Court did not parse the state court record in Reed because that \nrecord simply escaped this Court\u2019s attention.  \n\u201cThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly rooted in American \nconstitutional law.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at *6. To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered an injury in fact, (ii) the injury \nlikely was caused by the defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be redressed by \nthe requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 \n(1992). This Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he second and third standing \nrequirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often flip sides of the same coin. If \nthe defendant\u2019s actions cause an injury, enjoining that action or awarding damages \nfor the action will typically redress that injury.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL \n2964140, at *6 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThis Court applied that clear connection between causation and redressability \nin its analysis of Reed\u2019s standing in challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-\nconviction DNA statute. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, straightforwardly \nexplained: \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nrequested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, \n\n \n17 \n \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a \nfederal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the \nstate prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying testing. It is substantially \nlikely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234 (quotation omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe practical \nconsequences of that change [in law] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. \n(quotation omitted). Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s analysis of Reed\u2019s standing was clear, \ndirect, and easy to apply.  \nThis Court has advised that when courts have unanswered questions about \nstanding, they should look to similarly situated defendants for guidance: \u201cThe \n\u2018absence of precise definitions\u2019 has not left courts entirely at sea in applying the law \nof standing. Like \u2018most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable \ndefinition from developing case law.\u2019\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at \n*8 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). \u201cIn \u2018many cases the standing \nquestion can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u2013\n52). \nThe dissent below recognized that Gutierrez\u2019s case was in virtually the same \nposition as Reed. A16. The dissent\u2019s analysis was simple and followed this Court\u2019s \ndirective that, when it comes to standing, similarly situated litigants should be \ntreated the same. \n\n \n18 \n \nIn contrast, the panel majority did not look at the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s \ncomplaint and compare them to the allegations in Reed\u2019s complaint, despite both \nparties having filed 28(j) letters with the Fifth Circuit to address the impact of Reed \nhere. If it had, the majority would have seen that the allegation in Gutierrez\u2014that \nChapter 64 violates due process\u2014was identical to the allegation in Reed. Moreover, \nthe defendants in both cases were equivalent state officials, and the requested relief \nwas identical. The majority nonetheless failed to follow this Court\u2019s clear directive to \nanswer the standing question \u201cchiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u201d Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u201352. The \nmajority instead dispensed with the principle that standing applies equally to \nsimilarly situated parties and replaced it with a burdensome requirement that will \nhereupon individualize a plaintiff\u2019s standing. Under the majority\u2019s approach, \nstanding will now depend on how particular state officials\u2014or any federal \ndefendants\u2014may act in the future following a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  \nWhat is especially egregious about the Fifth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \nReed, however, is that the court\u2019s premise that Reed\u2019s posture in the CCA was \ndifferent than Gutierrez\u2019s posture is glaringly wrong. The panel majority postulated \nthat, \u201c[i]f Reed is to be distinguished from this case, we need to determine if the Court \nof Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations violated federal law, \nthat Reed\u2019s claim would fail.\u201d A13. The majority then concluded that the CCA had \nbeen silent on this question and distinguished Reed on the ground that \u201c[t]he Texas \n\n \n19 \n \ncourt made no holding in Reed comparable to its holding in Gutierrez.\u201d A13\u2013A14 n. 4. \nThe majority erred because its chosen distinction contradicts the events of Reed.  \nIn order to obtain DNA testing, Reed, like Gutierrez here, would still need to \nsatisfy all the requirements of Chapter 64, including that \u201cthe request for the \nproposed DNA testing is not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or \nadministration of justice.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(2)(B). The trial \ncourt found that Reed did not meet this requirement for seven distinct reasons. See \nReed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). On appeal, the CCA \naffirmed, \u201chold[ing] that Reed failed to establish that his request is not made to \nunreasonably delay the execution of his sentence or the administration of justice.\u201d Id. \nat 778. The CCA\u2019s analysis of why Reed cannot get relief because he cannot satisfy \n\u00a7 64.03(a)(2)(B) spans three pages\u2014far beyond the two sentences of dicta in the CCA\u2019s \nGutierrez opinions that the Fifth Circuit relied on here. The CCA thus squarely held \nthat Reed cannot obtain DNA testing for reasons that have nothing to do with the \nDNA statute\u2019s chain-of-custody limitations that Reed challenged in federal court. \nThis Court nonetheless held that Reed had standing because his complaints about \nChapter 64 were potentially redressable. The record in Reed thus refutes the \nmajority\u2019s attempt to distinguish it from this case.   \n \nThe Fifth Circuit may not disregard this Court\u2019s determinations and legal \nprecedents to strain for a result that it prefers. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-\nCruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a lower \ncourt in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it \n\n \n20 \n \nis essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court \ndecisions.\u201d); Winslow v. FERC, 587 F.3d 1133, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(\u201cVertical stare decisis\u2014both in letter and in spirit\u2014is a critical aspect of our \nhierarchical Judiciary headed by \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Const. art. III \n\u00a7 1)).  \nReversal of the Fifth Circuit is necessary to ensure adherence to this Court\u2019s \nconstitutional holdings, consistent application of a bedrock legal standard, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. See, e.g., James v. City of Boise, 577 U.S. 406, 307 (2016) \n(granting summary reversal and emphasizing that lower courts are \u201cbound by this \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Federal law\u201d); Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.S. 385, 395 (2016) (per \ncuriam) (noting that this Court \u201chas not shied away from deciding fact-intensive cases \nwhere, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law\u201d); Marmet \nHealth Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532 (2012) (per curiam) (granting \nsummary reversal where lower court\u2019s interpretation of federal law \u201cwas both \nincorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court\u201d). In \ncreating a novel requirement that conflicts with Reed, the Fifth Circuit majority has \nignored established Supreme Court precedent and created a circuit split where none \nshould exist. This Court should grant certiorari. \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant the writ of certiorari \nand stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in that court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n \nDated:  June 25, 2024",

See United States  v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nVAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 19\u2013783. Argued November 30, 2020\u2014Decided June 3, 2021 \nFormer Georgia police sergeant Nathan Van Buren used his patrol-car\ncomputer to access a law enforcement database to retrieve information\nabout a particular license plate number in exchange for money.  Alt-\nhough Van Buren used his own, valid credentials to perform the\nsearch, his conduct violated a department policy against obtaining da-tabase information for non-law-enforcement purposes.  Unbeknownst \nto Van Buren, his actions were part of a Federal Bureau of Investiga -\ntion sting operation.  Van Buren was charged with a felony violation \nof the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which subjectsto criminal liability anyone who \u201cintentionally accesses a computer \nwithout authorization or exceeds au thorized access.\u201d  18 U. S. C. \n\u00a71030(a)(2).  The term \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d is defined to mean \n\u201cto access a computer with authorization and to use such access to ob -\ntain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not enti-tled so to obtain or alter.\u201d  \u00a71030( e)(6).  A jury convicted Van Buren, \nand the District Court sentenced him to 18 months in prison.  Van Bu-\nren appealed to the Eleventh Circ uit, arguing that the \u201cexceeds au-\nthorized access\u201d clause applies only to those who obtain information to\nwhich their computer access does not extend, not to those who misuse \naccess that they otherwise have.  Consistent with Eleventh Circuit \nprecedent, the panel held that Van Buren had violated the CFAA. \nHeld : An individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d when he accesses a com-\nputer with authorization but then obtains information located in par-\nticular areas of the computer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014 \nthat are off-limits to him.

UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \ndispute whether Van Buren was \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d that infor-\nmation. Van Buren contends that the word \u201cso\u201d serves as a term of \nreference and that the disputed phra se thus asks whether one has the\nright, in \u201cthe same manner as has been  stated,\u201d to obtain the relevant\ninformation. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1246.  He also notes that the onlymanner of obtaining information already stated in the definitional pro-\nvision is by a computer one is author ized to access.  Thus, he continues, \nthe phrase \u201cis not entitled so to ob tain\u201d plainly refers to information \none is not allowed to obtain by using a computer that he is authorized \nto access . The Government argues that \u201cso\u201d sweeps more broadly,\nreading the phrase \u201cis not entitled so  to obtain\u201d to refer to information \none was not allowed to obtain in the particular manner or circum -\nstances in which he obtained it . And the manner or circumstances in \nwhich one has a right to obtain information, the Government says, are\ndefined by any \u201cspecifically and explicitly\u201d communicated limits on \none\u2019s right to access information.  Van Buren\u2019s account of \u201cso\u201d best \naligns with the term\u2019s plain meaning as a term of reference, as further \nreflected by other federal statutes that use \u201cso\u201d the same way.  Pp. 5\u2013 \n8. \n(2) The Government contends that Van Buren\u2019s reading renders the \nword \u201cso\u201d superfluous.  \u201cSo\u201d ma kes a valuable contribution, the Gov -\nernment insists, only if it incorpor ates all of the circumstances that \nmight qualify a person\u2019s right to ob tain information.  The Court disa-\ngrees because without \u201cso,\u201d the statut e could be read to incorporate all \nkinds of limitations on one\u2019s entitlement to information. Pp. 8\u20139.\n(3) The dissent accepts Van Buren\u2019s definition of \u201cso,\u201d but would ar-\nrive at the Government\u2019s result by way of the word \u201centitled.\u201d  Accord-ing to the dissent, the term \u201cent itled\u201d demands a \u201ccircumstance de-\npendent\u201d analysis of whether access was proper. But the word \n\u201centitled\u201d is modified by the phrase \u201cs o to obtain.\u201d  That phrase in turn\ndirects the reader to consider a spec ific limitation on the accesser\u2019s en-\ntitlement: his entitlement to obta in the information \u201cin the manner \npreviously stated.\u201d  And as alread y explained, the manner previously\nstated is using a computer one is auth orized to access.  To arrive at its \ninterpretation, the dissent must write the word \u201cso\u201d out of the statute. \nPp. 9\u201310.\n(4) The Government contends that in \u201ccommon parlance,\u201d the \nphrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d would be understood to mean thatVan Buren \u201cexceed[ed] his authorized access\u201d to the law enforcement \ndatabase when he obtained license-p late information for personal pur-\nposes.  The relevant question, however, is not whether Van Buren ex -\nceeded his authorized access but wh ether he exceeded his authorized \naccess as the CFAA defines that phrase .

Pp. 11\u2013 \n12. \n(b) The statute\u2019s structure further cuts against the Government\u2019s \nposition. Subsection (a)(2) specifies two distinct ways of obtaining in-\nformation unlawfully\u2014first, when an individual \u201caccesses a computer\nwithout authorization,\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2), and second, when an individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d by acce ssing a computer \u201cwith authoriza -\ntion\u201d and then obtaining information he  is \u201cnot entitled so to obtain,\u201d \n\u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2), (e)(6).  Van Buren cont ends that the \u201cwithout authoriza-\ntion\u201d clause protects computers th emselves from outside hackers, \nwhile the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d  clause provides complementary \nprotection for certain information within computers by targeting so-\ncalled inside hackers.  Under Van Bu ren\u2019s reading, liability under both \nclauses stems from a gates-up-or-do wn inquiry\u2014one either can or can-\nnot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot access cer-tain areas within the system.  This treats the clauses consistently andaligns with the computer-context under standing of access as entry.  By\ncontrast, the Government proposes to read the first phrase \u201cwithout authorization\u201d as a gates-up-or-down inquiry and the second phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as de pendent on the circumstances\u2014a \nreading inconsistent with subsection (a)(2)\u2019s design and structure.  The Government\u2019s reading leaves unanswered why the statute would pro-hibit accessing computer information,  but not the computer itself, for \nan improper purpose.\nAnother structural problem for the Government: \u00a71030(a)(2) also\ngives rise to civil liability, \u00a71030(g), with the statute defining \u201cdamage\u201d\nand \u201closs\u201d to specify what a plaintiff in a civil suit can recover. \n\u00a7\u00a71030(e)(8), (11).  Both terms focus on technological harms to com-puter data or systems.  Such provisions make sense in a scheme aimed\nat avoiding the ordinary consequenc es of hacking but are ill fitted to \nremediating \u201cmisuse\u201d of sensitive information that employees permis-\nsibly access using their computers.  Pp. 12\u201316.\n(c) The Government\u2019s claims that precedent and statutory history\nsupport its interpretation are easily dispatched.  This Court\u2019s decision \nin Musacchio  v. United States , 577 U. S. 237, did not address the issue \nhere, and the Court is not bound to follow any dicta in the case.  As for statutory history, the Government cl aims that the original 1984 Act\u2019s\nprecursor to the \u201cexceeds authorized  access\u201d language\u2014which covered\nany person who, \u201chaving accessed a computer with authorization, usesthe opportunity such access provides  for purposes to which such au-\nthorization does not extend\u201d\u2014supports its reading.  But that Congress\nremoved any reference to \u201cpurpose\u201d in the CFAA cuts against readingthe statute to cover purpose-based limitations.

UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \n(d) The Government\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cexceeds authorized ac-\ncess\u201d clause would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount \nof commonplace computer activity.  For instance, employers commonly \nstate that computers and electronic devices can be used only for busi -\nness purposes.  On the Government\u2019s  reading, an employee who sends\na personal e-mail or reads the news using a work computer has vio-lated the CFAA.  The Government sp eculates that other provisions\nmight limit its prosecutorial power, but its charging practice and policy \nindicate otherwise.  The Government\u2019s approach would also inject ar -\nbitrariness into the assessment of  criminal liability, because whether \nconduct like Van Buren\u2019s violated the CFAA would depend on how an\nemployer phrased the policy violated (as a \u201cuse\u201d restriction or an \u201cac-\ncess\u201d restriction).

Van Buren\u2019s conduct plainly \nflouted his department\u2019s policy, which authorized him to ob -\ntain database information only for law enforcement pur-poses. We must decide whet her Van Buren also violated \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which \nmakes it illegal \u201cto access a computer with authorization\nand to use such access to obtain or alter information in the \ncomputer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or \nalter.\u201d \nHe did not. This provision covers those who obtain infor-\nmation from particular areas in the computer\u2014such asfiles, folders, or databases\u2014to which their computer access \ndoes not extend.  It does not cover those who, like Van Bu-\nren, have improper motives fo r obtaining information that \nis otherwise available to them. \nI \nA \nTechnological advances at the dawn of the 1980s brought \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 2 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \ncomputers to schools, offices, and homes across the Nation. \nBut as the public and private sectors harnessed the power\nof computing for improvement and innovation, so-called hackers hatched ways to coopt computers for illegal ends. \nAfter a series of highly publicized hackings captured the\npublic\u2019s attention, it became clear that traditional theft and\ntrespass statutes were ill suited to address cybercrimes\nthat did not deprive computer ow ners of property in the tra-\nditional sense.  See Kerr, Cybercrime\u2019s Scope: Interpreting\n\u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAuthorization\u201d in Computer Misuse Statutes, \n78 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1596, 1605\u20131613 (2003). \nCongress, following the lead of several States, responded \nby enacting the first federal computer-crime statute as partof the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  \u00a72102(a),\n98 Stat. 2190\u20132192.  A few years later, Congress passed the\nCFAA, which included the provisions at issue in this case. The Act subjects to criminal liability anyone who \u201cinten -\ntionally accesses a computer without authorization or ex-ceeds authorized access,\u201d and thereby obtains computer in-\nformation. 18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(a)(2).  It defines the term \n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d to mean \u201cto access a computer\nwith authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter \ninformation in the computer that the accesser is not enti -\ntled so to obtain or alter.\u201d  \u00a71030(e)(6). \nInitially, subsection (a)(2)\u2019s prohibition barred accessing \nonly certain financial information.  It has since expanded to \ncover any information from any computer \u201cused in or affect-\ning interstate or foreign co mmerce or communication.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(2)(B).  As a result, the prohibition now applies\u2014at a minimum\u2014to all information from all computers that \nconnect to the Internet. \u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2)(C), (e)(2)(B). \nThose who violate \u00a71030(a)(2) face penalties ranging from\nfines and misdemeanor sentences to imprisonment for up to10 years. \u00a71030(c)(2).

In the course of his duties, Van Buren \ncrossed paths with a man named Andrew Albo. The deputy\nchief of Van Buren\u2019s department considered Albo to be \u201cvery\nvolatile\u201d and warned officers in  the department to deal with\nhim carefully. Notwithstanding that warning, Van Buren \ndeveloped a friendly relationship with Albo.  Or so Van Bu -\nren thought when he went to Albo  to ask for a personal loan. \nUnbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo  secretly recorded that re -\nquest and took it to the local sheriff \u2019s office, where he com -\nplained that Van Buren had sought to \u201cshake him down\u201d for cash. \nThe taped conversation made its way to the Federal Bu-\nreau of Investigation (FBI), which devised an operation to see how far Van Buren would go for money.  The steps were \nstraightforward: Albo would ask Van Buren to search the \nstate law enforcement computer database for a license plate\npurportedly belonging to a woman whom Albo had met at a\nlocal strip club. Albo, no stranger to legal troubles, wouldtell Van Buren that he wanted to ensure that the woman \nwas not in fact an undercover o fficer.  In return for the \nsearch, Albo would pay Van Buren around $5,000.\nThings went according to plan.  Van Buren used his \npatrol-car computer to access the law enforcement database \nwith his valid credentials.  He searched the database for the \nlicense plate that Albo had provided.  After obtaining the \nFBI-created license-plate entry , Van Buren told Albo that \nhe had information to share. \nThe Federal Government then charged Van Buren with a\nfelony violation of the CFAA on the ground that running the \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  4 VAN BUREN v.

C. \u00a71030(a)(2).\n1 The trial evidence \nshowed that Van Buren had been trained not to use the law \nenforcement database for \u201can improper purpose,\u201d defined as\n\u201cany personal use.\u201d App. 17.  Van Buren therefore knew \nthat the search breached department policy. And according\nto the Government, that violat ion of department policy also \nviolated the CFAA. Consistent  with that position, the Gov-\nernment told the jury that Van Buren\u2019s access of the data -\nbase \u201cfor a non[- ]law[-]enforcement purpose\u201d violated the\nCFAA \u201cconcept\u201d against \u201cusing\u201d a computer network in a \nway contrary to \u201cwhat your job or policy prohibits.\u201d  Id., at \n39. The jury convicted Van Buren, and the District Court\nsentenced him to 18 months in prison.\nVan Buren appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, arguing\nthat the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause applies only to\nthose who obtain information to which their computer ac -\ncess does not extend, not to those who misuse access that \nthey otherwise have. While several Circuits see the clause Van Buren\u2019s way, the Eleventh Circuit is among those that\nhave taken a broader view.\n2 Consistent with its Circuit \nprecedent, the panel held that Van Buren had violated the\nCFAA by accessing the law enforcement database for an\u201cinappropriate reason.\u201d  940 F. 3d 1192, 1208 (2019).

S. ___ (2020). \nII \nA \n1 \nBoth Van Buren and the Government raise a host of pol-\nicy arguments to support their respective interpretations.\nBut we start where we always do: with the text of the stat-\nute. Here, the most relevant text is the phrase \u201cexceeds au-\nthorized access,\u201d which means \u201cto access a computer withauthorization and to use such access to obtain . . . infor-\nmation in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so\nto obtain.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6).\nThe parties agree that Van Buren \u201caccess[ed] a computer\nwith authorization\u201d when he used his patrol-car computerand valid credentials to log into the law enforcement data-\nbase.  They also agree that Van Buren \u201cobtain[ed] . . . infor-\nmation in the computer\u201d when he acquired the license-plate \nrecord for Albo.  The dispute is whether Van Buren was \u201cen-\ntitled so to obtain\u201d the record. \n\u201cEntitle\u201d means \u201cto give . . . a title, right, or claim to\nsomething.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-guage 649 (2d ed. 1987).  See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n477 (5th ed. 1979) (\u201cto give a right or legal title to\u201d).  The \nparties agree that Van Buren had been given the right to acquire license-plate information\u2014that is, he was \u201centitled \nto obtain\u201d it\u2014from the law enforcement computer database. \nBut was Van Buren \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d the license-plate\ninformation, as the statute requires? \nVan Buren says yes. He notes that \u201cso,\u201d as used in this \nstatute, serves as a term of reference that recalls \u201cthe same \nmanner as has been stated\u201d or \u201cthe way or manner de-\nscribed.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 1246; 15 Oxford Eng-\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 6 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nlish Dictionary 887 (2d ed. 1989).  The disputed phrase \u201cen-\ntitled so to obtain\u201d thus asks whether one has the right, in\n\u201cthe same manner as has been stated,\u201d to obtain the rele-vant information.  And the only manner of obtaining infor-\nmation already stated in the definitional provision is \u201cvia a \ncomputer [one] is otherwise authorized to access.\u201d  Reply\nBrief 3. Putting that together, Van Buren contends that the \ndisputed phrase\u2014\u201cis not entitled so to obtain\u201d\u2014plainly re-\nfers to information one is not allowed to obtain by using a \ncomputer that he is authorized to access. On this reading, ifa person has access to information stored in a computer\u2014 \ne.g., in \u201cFolder Y,\u201d from which the person could permissibly \npull information\u2014then he does not violate the CFAA by ob-\ntaining such information, regardless of whether he pulled\nthe information for a prohibited purpose. But if the infor-mation is instead located in prohibited \u201cFolder X,\u201d to which\nthe person lacks access, he violates the CFAA by obtaining \nsuch information. \nThe Government agrees that the statute uses \u201cso\u201d in the \nword\u2019s term-of-reference sense, but it argues that \u201cso\u201d sweeps more broadly.  It reads the phrase \u201cis not entitled so \nto obtain\u201d to refer to informat ion one was not allowed to ob-\ntain in the particular manner or circumstances in which he \nobtained it .  The manner or circumstances in which one has \na right to obtain information, the Government says, are de-\nfined by any \u201cspecifically and  explicitly\u201d communicated lim-\nits on one\u2019s right to access information.  Brief for United \nStates 19. As the Government sees it, an employee might\nlawfully pull information from Folder Y in the morning for \na permissible purpose\u2014say, to prepare for a business meet-\ning\u2014but unlawfully pull the same information from Folder \nY in the afternoon for a prohibited purpose\u2014say, to help draft a resume to submit to a competitor employer. \nThe Government\u2019s interpretation has surface appeal but\nproves to be a sleight of hand.

Instead, \u201cso\u201d captures any circumstance-based limit appearing any-\nwhere \u2014in the United States Code, a state statute, a private\nagreement, or anywhere else. And while the Government \ntries to cabin its interpretation by suggesting that any such\nlimit must be \u201cspecifically and  explicitly\u201d stated, \u201cexpress,\u201d \nand \u201cinherent in the authorization itself,\u201d the Government does not identify any textual basis for these guardrails.

According to  the Government, \u201cso\u201d adds\nnothing to the sentence if it refers solely to the earlier\nstated manner of obtaining the information through use ofa computer one has accessed with authorization.  What \nmatters on Van Buren\u2019s reading, as the Government sees \nit, is simply that the person obtain information that he is\nnot entitled to obtain\u2014and t hat point could be made even \nif \u201cso\u201d were deleted. By co ntrast, the Government insists, \n\u201cso\u201d makes a valuable contribution if it incorporates all of the circumstances that might qualify a person\u2019s right to ob-\ntain information. Because only its interpretation gives \u201cso\u201d \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nother property to have been so embezz led, stolen, [or] converted . . . re -\ntains the same with intent to convert it to his use,\u201d is subject to punish-ment); \u00a71708 (\u201c[W]hoever steals, takes,  or abstracts, or by fraud or de-\nception obtains, or attempts so to obtain,\u201d parcels of mail is subject to\npunishment). \n4The dissent criticizes this interpretation as inconsistent with \u201cbasic \nprinciples of property law,\u201d and in pa rticular the \u201cfamiliar rule that an \nentitlement to use another person\u2019s pr operty is circumstance specific.\u201d \nPost, at 4\u20135 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.).  But common-law principles \u201cshould\nbe imported into statutory text only when Congress employs a common-\nlaw term\u201d\u2014not when Congress has out lined an offense \u201canalogous to a \ncommon-law crime without using common-law terms.\u201d  Carter v. United \nStates, 530 U. S. 255, 265 (2000) (emphasis deleted).  Relying on the com-mon law is particularly ill advised here  because it was the failure of pre -\nexisting law to capture computer crime  that helped spur Congress to en-\nact the CFAA.

S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at \n10).\nBut the canon does not help the Government because Van\nBuren\u2019s reading does not render \u201cso\u201d superfluous.  As Van \nBuren points out, without \u201cso,\u201d the statute would allow in-\ndividuals to use their right to obtain information in nondig-ital form as a defense to CFAA liability.  Consider, for ex -\nample, a person who downloads restricted personnel fileshe is not entitled to obtain by using his computer. Such a \nperson could argue that he was \u201centitled to obtain\u201d the in-\nformation if he had the right to access personnel files through another method ( e.g., by requesting hard copies of\nthe files from human resources). With \u201cso,\u201d the CFAA fore -\ncloses that theory of defense. The statute is concerned with \nwhat a person does on a computer; it does not excuse hack-\ning into an electronic personnel file if the hacker could have\nwalked down the hall to pick up a physical copy.\nThis clarification is signif icant because it underscores \nthat one kind of entitlement to information counts: the right\nto access the information by using a computer. That can \nexpand liability, as the above example shows.  But it nar-rows liability too. Without the word \u201cso,\u201d the statute could \nbe read to incorporate all kinds of limitations on one\u2019s enti-\ntlement to information. The dissent\u2019s take on the statute \nillustrates why. \n3 \nWhile the dissent accepts Van Buren\u2019s definition of \u201cso,\u201d\nit would arrive at the Govern ment\u2019s result by way of the \nword \u201centitled.\u201d  One is \u201centitled\u201d to do something, the dis-sent contends, only when \u201c \u2018proper grounds\u2019 \u201d are in place. \nPost, at 3 (opinion of T\nHOMAS , J.)

UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nto obtain information, the dissent continues, therefore de -\nmands a \u201ccircumstance dependent\u201d analysis of whether ac-\ncess was proper. Post, at 3.  This reading, like the Govern-\nment\u2019s, would extend the statute\u2019s reach to any \ncircumstance-based limit appearing anywhere. \nThe dissent\u2019s approach to the word \u201centitled\u201d fares fine in \nthe abstract but poorly in context.  The statute does not re-\nfer to \u201cinformation . . . that the accesser is not entitled to \nobtain.\u201d It refers to \u201cinformation . . . that the accesser is not \nentitled so to obtain.\u201d  18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis \nadded). The word \u201centitled,\u201d then, does not stand alone, in -\nviting the reader to consider the full scope of the accesser\u2019s\nentitlement to information.  The modifying phrase \u201cso to ob-tain\u201d directs the reader to consider a specific limitation on \nthe accesser\u2019s entitlement: his entitlement to obtain the in-\nformation \u201cin the manner previously stated.\u201d Supra,  at 7. \nAnd as already explained, the manner previously stated isusing a computer one is authorized to access. Thus, while \ngiving lipservice to Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso,\u201d the dissent, \nlike the Government, declines to give \u201cso\u201d any limiting func-\ntion.\n5 \nThe dissent cannot have it both ways.  The consequence\nof accepting Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso\u201d is the narrowedscope of \u201centitled.\u201d In fact, th e dissent\u2019s examples implicitly\nconcede as much: They all omit the word \u201cso,\u201d thereby giv-ing \u201centitled\u201d its full sweep.  See post, at 3\u20134.  An approach\nthat must rewrite the statute to work is even less persua-\nsive than the Government\u2019s. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5For the same reason, the dissent is incorrect when it contends that \nour interpretation reads the additional words \u201cunder any possible cir-\ncumstance\u201d into the statute.  Post, at 3 (emphasis deleted).  Our reading\ninstead interprets the phrase \u201cso to obtain\u201d to incorporate the single \u201ccir-cumstance\u201d of permissible informatio n access identified by the statute:\nobtaining the information by using one\u2019s computer. \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n 11 Cite as: 593 U.

According to \nthe Government, any ordinary speaker of the English lan-\nguage would think that Van Buren \u201cexceed[ed] his author-\nized access\u201d to the law enforcement database when he ob-\ntained license-plate information for personal purposes. Id., \nat 21. The dissent, for its part, asserts that this point \u201cset-\ntles\u201d the case. Post, at 9. \nIf the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d were all we had\nto go on, the Government and the dissent might have a \npoint. But both breeze by the CFAA\u2019s explicit definition of the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access.\u201d  When \u201ca statute \nincludes an explicit definition\u201d of a term, \u201cwe must follow \nthat definition, even if it varies from a term\u2019s ordinary\nmeaning.\u201d Tanzin v. Tanvir , 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip \nop., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). So the rele -\nvant question is not whether Van Buren exceeded his au-\nthorized access but whether he exceeded his authorized ac-\ncess as the CFAA defines that phrase. And as we have \nalready explained, the statutory definition favors Van Bu-ren\u2019s reading.\nThat reading, moreover, is perfectly consistent with the\nway that an \u201cappropriately informed\u201d speaker of the lan-guage would understand the meaning of \u201cexceeds author-\nized access.\u201d Nelson, What Is Textualism?  91 Va.

The \u201cwithout authoriza-\ntion\u201d clause, Van Buren contends, protects computers them-selves by targeting so-called outside hackers\u2014those who \n\u201cacces[s] a computer without any permission at all.\u201d LVRC \nHoldings LLC v. Brekka , 581 F. 3d 1127, 1133 (CA9 2009); \nsee also Pulte Homes, Inc. v. Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of North \nAm., 648 F. 3d 295, 304 (CA6 2011).  Van Buren reads the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause to provide complemen-\ntary protection for certain information within computers.  It does so, Van Buren asserts, by  targeting so-called inside \nhackers\u2014those who access a computer with permission, but then \u201c \u2018exceed\u2019 the parameters of authorized access by en-\ntering an area of the computer to which [that] authorization does not extend.\u201d  United States v. Valle , 807 F. 3d 508, 524 \n(CA2 2015).\nVan Buren\u2019s account of subsection (a)(2) makes sense of\nthe statutory structure because it treats the \u201cwithout au -\nthorization\u201d and \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clauses con -\nsistently. Under Van Buren\u2019s reading, liability under both clauses stems from a gates-up-or-down inquiry\u2014one either \ncan or cannot access a computer system, and one either can\nor cannot access certain areas within the system.\n8  A n d \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8For present purposes, we need not address whether th is inquiry turns\nonly on technological (or \u201ccode-based\u201d)  limitations on access, or instead\nalso looks to limits contained in cont racts or policies.

UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nreading both clauses to adopt a gates-up-or-down approach\naligns with the computer-context understanding of access \nas entry. See supra, at 11\u201312.9 \nBy contrast, the Government\u2019s reading of the \u201cexceeds au -\nthorized access\u201d clause creates \u201cinconsistenc[ies] with thedesign and structure\u201d of subsection (a)(2). University of \nTex. Southwestern Medical Center  v. Nassar , 570 U. S. 338, \n353 (2013).  As discussed, the Government reads the \u201cex-\nceeds authorized access\u201d clause to incorporate purpose-\nbased limits contained in contracts and workplace policies. Yet the Government does not read such limits into the \nthreshold question whether someone uses a computer \n\u201cwithout authorization\u201d\u2014even though similar purpose re-\nstrictions, like a rule against personal use, often govern \none\u2019s right to access a computer in the first place.  See, e.g., Royal Truck & Trailer Sales & Serv ., Inc. v. Kraft , 974 F. 3d \n756, 757 (CA6 2020). Thus, the Government proposes to read the first phrase \u201cwithout  authorization\u201d as a gates-up-\nor-down inquiry and the second phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as one that depends on the circumstances.  The Gov-ernment does not explain why the statute would prohibit \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9Van Buren\u2019s gates-up-or-down reading also aligns with the CFAA\u2019s\nprohibition on password trafficking. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. Enacted \nalongside the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d definition in 1986, the pass-\nword-trafficking provision bars the sale  of \u201cany password or similar in -\nformation through which a computer  may be accessed without authori-\nzation.\u201d \u00a71030(a)(6). The provision thus contemplates a \u201cspecific type of \nauthorization\u2014that is, authentication ,\u201d which turns on whether a user\u2019s \ncredentials allow him to proceed past a computer\u2019s access gate, rather than on other, scope-based restrict ions.  Bellia, A Code-Based Approach \nto Unauthorized Access Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 84\nGeo. Wash. L. Rev. 1442, 1470 (2016); cf. A Dictionary of Computing, at30 (defining \u201cauthorization\u201d as a \u201cprocess by which users, having com-pleted an . . . authentication stage, ga in or are denied access to particular\nresources based on their entitlement\u201d). \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 15 Cite as: 593 U.

Recall that violating \u00a71030(a)(2), the provision under\nwhich Van Buren was charged, also gives rise to civil liabil-\nity. See \u00a71030(g). Provisions defining \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d \nspecify what a plaintiff in a civil suit can recover. \n\u201c\u2018[D]amage,\u2019 \u201d the statute provides, means \u201cany impairment \nto the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system,\nor information.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(8).  The term \u201closs\u201d likewise re-\nlates to costs caused by harm to computer data, programs, systems, or information servic es.  \u00a71030(e)(11). The statu-\ntory definitions of \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d thus focus on tech-nological harms\u2014such as the corruption of files\u2014of the \ntype unauthorized users cause to computer systems and \ndata. Limiting \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d in this way makes sense in a scheme \u201caimed at preventing the typical conse-\nquences of hacking.\u201d Royal Truck , 974 F. 3d, at 760.  The \nterm\u2019s definitions are ill fitted, however, to remediating \u201cmisuse\u201d of sensitive information that employees may per-\nmissibly access using their computers. Ibid.

Criminal Justice Faulty tests spur questions about DNA findings in criminal cases in Texas and nationally Texas Public Radio | By Paul Flahive Published\u00a0May 5, 2025 at 10:56 AM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Jim Young / ReutersDNA analysis Sign up for\u00a0TPR Today, Texas Public Radio's newsletter that brings our top stories to your inbox each morning.DNA tests for criminal cases across Texas are getting second looks from labs because one of the largest DNA test manufacturers globally told customers about issues with some tests distributed from February 2024 to October 2024.Officials at Qiagen, the multi-billion-dollar maker of DNA tests, alerted customers in Texas and Virginia that they received complaints that their EZ1&2 Investigator Kits were extracting less DNA than expected.Complaints reported that some tests incorrectly represented that not enough DNA existed to test, and others represented samples that had multiple people\u2019s DNA present as fewer or just one person\u2019s genetic material.Assessing the scope of the impact of affected tests was difficult to determine because Qiagen has not disclosed the total number of tests or where affected tests may have been sent.\u201cWe have received fewer than 10 complaints nationwide on this matter, and the number of kits involved has been well below 1% of annual manufacturing,\u201d said John Gilardi, vice president and head of corporate communications, in a statement.But Gilardi declined to say how many kits the company produces in a year. The company is one of the biggest providers in the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Peter Stout, president of the Houston Forensic Science Center (HFSC). \u201cThis is a product that almost everybody uses \u2026 all across the U.S., all across the world.\u201dQiagen declined to give TPR an interview because it was a public holiday in Europe but responded to some questions in writing. Officials said the tests met their internal quality control measures, and while the company recovered stock from labs, it was not a recall. Screengrab / Qiagen websiteQiagen EZ1&2 Investigator Kits The results, however, are leading forensic scientists in those labs to question if results are scientifically reliable.The Houston Forensic Science Center disclosed the intermittent problems it and other labs were having at an April 11 meeting of the Texas Forensic Science Commission. Texas is one of few states with a public agency overseeing how forensic science is used in courts.HFSC discovered the problems with the tests and brought it to the company\u2019s attention last year. Stout told the commission that the HFSC had several conversations with the company.In a letter to clients dated April 1, Qiagen said it made production changes at its factory to address the issue in October 2024 after alerting customers of the complaints.\u201cBased on the data available, there is no indication of a broader or systemic issue,\u201d said the letter.The tests used for dried blood, bone, semen, saliva, and trace DNA are largely for criminal prosecutions, meaning the stakes are high when errors occur.\u201cTexas is a death penalty state, many others are. Justice is a matter of life and death,\u201d said Michael Kessler, principal at Kessler Forensic Solutions, a company that consults on DNA analysis in trials.The affected tests at times fail to always produce a DNA profile when it is present.\u201cWe run the risk of missing a profile that could be potentially exonerating. We also run the risk of missing a profile that could be of importance for an investigation. So basically, you could think of the sexual assault kit that we don't get the profile of. The potential offender \u2026 they go un-arrested,\u201d Stout said.The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed that its Austin laboratory uses the tests, and it was reviewing 700 cases for next steps. The HFSC confirmed it will likely review hundreds more cases. But the impacts could be far greater nationwide, according to experts.\u201cI would think if they wanted to have an abundance of caution, they could go back now to case work samples, where they got \u2018no\u2019 results,\u201d said Dan Krane, professor at Wright University and consultant for forensic testing.That is if there is now enough material to test. \u201cA lot of these evidence samples are going to be low quantity. Swabs of gun cartridges, for instance, and they had one crack at it, and you just can't go back,\u201d he added.The costs of retesting will be incurred by the labs.The HFSC discovered the testing irregularities through its own quality assurance program. When officials reviewed the data, they saw a jump in the number of samples between June and August 2024 they sent out to contract labs coming back with so-called \u201cunintuitive results\u201d rising from about two samples to 45.\u201cThat's a 14% rate,\u201d Stout told the Texas Forensic Science Commission. \u201cThat stuck out.\u201dHFSC noted areas of improvement for Qiagen going forward in its presentation, including testing more of the cartridges. It found Qiagen tested only 36 cartridges per lot with an average size of 83,000. Statistically, it should have checked 235 cartridges for a 95% confidence rate, the HFSC presentation added.What makes any analysis difficult is that Qiagen declined to disclose to TPR how big its lot sizes were.Qiagen explained that it conducted a full investigation and that all the kits passed all the company\u2019s quality control standards.\u201cI think what's more concerning is the length of time over which this problem was occurring, the fact that the quality control program for the manufacturer did not catch the issue,\u201d said Elizabeth Daniel Vasquez, a former public defender who now consults for criminal defense teams on forensic science. Courtesy photo / Houston Forensic Science Center Qiagen cartridge The culprit for the issues was tentatively identified as the pH balance of one of the chemicals \u2014 the MTL buffer \u2014 used in the tests. HFSC noted other issues with cartridges \u2014 the long rectangular devices designed with numerous wells to hold components of the DNA testing process like chemicals. Upon visual inspection, scientists found a magnetic bead and specific chemicals in the wrong wells.It wasn\u2019t clear how many labs across Texas or nationally received the affected tests, but among them was the Department of Public Safety\u2019s offices in Austin as well as private testing labs Bode, based in Virginia, and Signature Science, based in Austin. Signature Science is a subsidiary of San Antonio\u2019s Southwest Research Institute.Two letters to labs reviewed by TPR showed that Signature Science and others were contacted by Qiagen in October 2024 about the issues.In a letter dated April 23, Signature Science told its clients that Qiagen failed to identify all affected lots and that its lab\u2019s DNA extraction work was also impacted this year.\u201cSignature Science believes any sample extracted between June 24, 2024, through February 28, 2025, that utilized EZ1&2 DNA Investigator reagent cartridge lots 178019172, 178026981, 178029201, or 178032040 may be impacted by this issue.,\u201d said Samantha Wandzek, technical leader for Signature Science, in a letter to clients obtained by TPR.Signature Science did not respond to TPR\u2019s requests for comment.In another letter obtained by TPR, Bode labs said it had internally tested the affected lots and \u201cit is unlikely that samples processed at Bode have been affected by this sporadic issue.\u201dQiagen said it has been responsive to labs\u2019 concerns. \u201cIn every case we\u2019ve worked directly with the lab to investigate the concern, perform follow-up testing and provide full support,\u201d Gilardi wrote in an email.But those assurances may not be enough for defense attorneys.\u201cWe're going to see a ton of cases where the impact of this is going to be directly clear,\u201d said Daniel Vasquez. \u201cI think more likely what we'll see is a whole lot of lack of evidence that nobody realizes was lost in the process.\u201d TPR was founded by and is supported by our community.

See United States  v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nVAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 19\u2013783. Argued November 30, 2020\u2014Decided June 3, 2021 \nFormer Georgia police sergeant Nathan Van Buren used his patrol-car\ncomputer to access a law enforcement database to retrieve information\nabout a particular license plate number in exchange for money.  Alt-\nhough Van Buren used his own, valid credentials to perform the\nsearch, his conduct violated a department policy against obtaining da-tabase information for non-law-enforcement purposes.  Unbeknownst \nto Van Buren, his actions were part of a Federal Bureau of Investiga -\ntion sting operation.  Van Buren was charged with a felony violation \nof the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which subjectsto criminal liability anyone who \u201cintentionally accesses a computer \nwithout authorization or exceeds au thorized access.\u201d  18 U. S. C. \n\u00a71030(a)(2).  The term \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d is defined to mean \n\u201cto access a computer with authorization and to use such access to ob -\ntain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not enti-tled so to obtain or alter.\u201d  \u00a71030( e)(6).  A jury convicted Van Buren, \nand the District Court sentenced him to 18 months in prison.  Van Bu-\nren appealed to the Eleventh Circ uit, arguing that the \u201cexceeds au-\nthorized access\u201d clause applies only to those who obtain information to\nwhich their computer access does not extend, not to those who misuse \naccess that they otherwise have.  Consistent with Eleventh Circuit \nprecedent, the panel held that Van Buren had violated the CFAA. \nHeld : An individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d when he accesses a com-\nputer with authorization but then obtains information located in par-\nticular areas of the computer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014 \nthat are off-limits to him. Pp. 5\u201320.\n(a) (1) The parties agree that Va n Buren \u201caccess[ed] a computer with\nauthorization\u201d and \u201cobtain[ed] . . . information in the computer.\u201d  They \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  2 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \ndispute whether Van Buren was \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d that infor-\nmation. Van Buren contends that the word \u201cso\u201d serves as a term of \nreference and that the disputed phra se thus asks whether one has the\nright, in \u201cthe same manner as has been  stated,\u201d to obtain the relevant\ninformation. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1246.  He also notes that the onlymanner of obtaining information already stated in the definitional pro-\nvision is by a computer one is author ized to access.  Thus, he continues, \nthe phrase \u201cis not entitled so to ob tain\u201d plainly refers to information \none is not allowed to obtain by using a computer that he is authorized \nto access . The Government argues that \u201cso\u201d sweeps more broadly,\nreading the phrase \u201cis not entitled so  to obtain\u201d to refer to information \none was not allowed to obtain in the particular manner or circum -\nstances in which he obtained it . And the manner or circumstances in \nwhich one has a right to obtain information, the Government says, are\ndefined by any \u201cspecifically and explicitly\u201d communicated limits on \none\u2019s right to access information.  Van Buren\u2019s account of \u201cso\u201d best \naligns with the term\u2019s plain meaning as a term of reference, as further \nreflected by other federal statutes that use \u201cso\u201d the same way.  Pp. 5\u2013 \n8. \n(2) The Government contends that Van Buren\u2019s reading renders the \nword \u201cso\u201d superfluous.  \u201cSo\u201d ma kes a valuable contribution, the Gov -\nernment insists, only if it incorpor ates all of the circumstances that \nmight qualify a person\u2019s right to ob tain information.  The Court disa-\ngrees because without \u201cso,\u201d the statut e could be read to incorporate all \nkinds of limitations on one\u2019s entitlement to information. Pp. 8\u20139.\n(3) The dissent accepts Van Buren\u2019s definition of \u201cso,\u201d but would ar-\nrive at the Government\u2019s result by way of the word \u201centitled.\u201d  Accord-ing to the dissent, the term \u201cent itled\u201d demands a \u201ccircumstance de-\npendent\u201d analysis of whether access was proper. But the word \n\u201centitled\u201d is modified by the phrase \u201cs o to obtain.\u201d  That phrase in turn\ndirects the reader to consider a spec ific limitation on the accesser\u2019s en-\ntitlement: his entitlement to obta in the information \u201cin the manner \npreviously stated.\u201d  And as alread y explained, the manner previously\nstated is using a computer one is auth orized to access.  To arrive at its \ninterpretation, the dissent must write the word \u201cso\u201d out of the statute. \nPp. 9\u201310.\n(4) The Government contends that in \u201ccommon parlance,\u201d the \nphrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d would be understood to mean thatVan Buren \u201cexceed[ed] his authorized access\u201d to the law enforcement \ndatabase when he obtained license-p late information for personal pur-\nposes.  The relevant question, however, is not whether Van Buren ex -\nceeded his authorized access but wh ether he exceeded his authorized \naccess as the CFAA defines that phrase . For reasons given elsewhere, \nhe did not.  Nor is it contrary to  the meaning of the defined term to \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  3 Cite as: 593 U.

Pp. 11\u2013 \n12. \n(b) The statute\u2019s structure further cuts against the Government\u2019s \nposition. Subsection (a)(2) specifies two distinct ways of obtaining in-\nformation unlawfully\u2014first, when an individual \u201caccesses a computer\nwithout authorization,\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2), and second, when an individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d by acce ssing a computer \u201cwith authoriza -\ntion\u201d and then obtaining information he  is \u201cnot entitled so to obtain,\u201d \n\u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2), (e)(6).  Van Buren cont ends that the \u201cwithout authoriza-\ntion\u201d clause protects computers th emselves from outside hackers, \nwhile the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d  clause provides complementary \nprotection for certain information within computers by targeting so-\ncalled inside hackers.  Under Van Bu ren\u2019s reading, liability under both \nclauses stems from a gates-up-or-do wn inquiry\u2014one either can or can-\nnot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot access cer-tain areas within the system.  This treats the clauses consistently andaligns with the computer-context under standing of access as entry.  By\ncontrast, the Government proposes to read the first phrase \u201cwithout authorization\u201d as a gates-up-or-down inquiry and the second phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as de pendent on the circumstances\u2014a \nreading inconsistent with subsection (a)(2)\u2019s design and structure.  The Government\u2019s reading leaves unanswered why the statute would pro-hibit accessing computer information,  but not the computer itself, for \nan improper purpose.\nAnother structural problem for the Government: \u00a71030(a)(2) also\ngives rise to civil liability, \u00a71030(g), with the statute defining \u201cdamage\u201d\nand \u201closs\u201d to specify what a plaintiff in a civil suit can recover. \n\u00a7\u00a71030(e)(8), (11).  Both terms focus on technological harms to com-puter data or systems.  Such provisions make sense in a scheme aimed\nat avoiding the ordinary consequenc es of hacking but are ill fitted to \nremediating \u201cmisuse\u201d of sensitive information that employees permis-\nsibly access using their computers.  Pp. 12\u201316.\n(c) The Government\u2019s claims that precedent and statutory history\nsupport its interpretation are easily dispatched.  This Court\u2019s decision \nin Musacchio  v. United States , 577 U. S. 237, did not address the issue \nhere, and the Court is not bound to follow any dicta in the case.  As for statutory history, the Government cl aims that the original 1984 Act\u2019s\nprecursor to the \u201cexceeds authorized  access\u201d language\u2014which covered\nany person who, \u201chaving accessed a computer with authorization, usesthe opportunity such access provides  for purposes to which such au-\nthorization does not extend\u201d\u2014supports its reading.  But that Congress\nremoved any reference to \u201cpurpose\u201d in the CFAA cuts against readingthe statute to cover purpose-based limitations.

UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \n(d) The Government\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cexceeds authorized ac-\ncess\u201d clause would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount \nof commonplace computer activity.  For instance, employers commonly \nstate that computers and electronic devices can be used only for busi -\nness purposes.  On the Government\u2019s  reading, an employee who sends\na personal e-mail or reads the news using a work computer has vio-lated the CFAA.  The Government sp eculates that other provisions\nmight limit its prosecutorial power, but its charging practice and policy \nindicate otherwise.  The Government\u2019s approach would also inject ar -\nbitrariness into the assessment of  criminal liability, because whether \nconduct like Van Buren\u2019s violated the CFAA would depend on how an\nemployer phrased the policy violated (as a \u201cuse\u201d restriction or an \u201cac-\ncess\u201d restriction).

Van Buren\u2019s conduct plainly \nflouted his department\u2019s policy, which authorized him to ob -\ntain database information only for law enforcement pur-poses. We must decide whet her Van Buren also violated \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which \nmakes it illegal \u201cto access a computer with authorization\nand to use such access to obtain or alter information in the \ncomputer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or \nalter.\u201d \nHe did not. This provision covers those who obtain infor-\nmation from particular areas in the computer\u2014such asfiles, folders, or databases\u2014to which their computer access \ndoes not extend.  It does not cover those who, like Van Bu-\nren, have improper motives fo r obtaining information that \nis otherwise available to them. \nI \nA \nTechnological advances at the dawn of the 1980s brought \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 2 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \ncomputers to schools, offices, and homes across the Nation. \nBut as the public and private sectors harnessed the power\nof computing for improvement and innovation, so-called hackers hatched ways to coopt computers for illegal ends. \nAfter a series of highly publicized hackings captured the\npublic\u2019s attention, it became clear that traditional theft and\ntrespass statutes were ill suited to address cybercrimes\nthat did not deprive computer ow ners of property in the tra-\nditional sense.  See Kerr, Cybercrime\u2019s Scope: Interpreting\n\u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAuthorization\u201d in Computer Misuse Statutes, \n78 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1596, 1605\u20131613 (2003). \nCongress, following the lead of several States, responded \nby enacting the first federal computer-crime statute as partof the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  \u00a72102(a),\n98 Stat. 2190\u20132192.  A few years later, Congress passed the\nCFAA, which included the provisions at issue in this case. The Act subjects to criminal liability anyone who \u201cinten -\ntionally accesses a computer without authorization or ex-ceeds authorized access,\u201d and thereby obtains computer in-\nformation. 18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(a)(2).  It defines the term \n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d to mean \u201cto access a computer\nwith authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter \ninformation in the computer that the accesser is not enti -\ntled so to obtain or alter.\u201d  \u00a71030(e)(6). \nInitially, subsection (a)(2)\u2019s prohibition barred accessing \nonly certain financial information.  It has since expanded to \ncover any information from any computer \u201cused in or affect-\ning interstate or foreign co mmerce or communication.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(2)(B).  As a result, the prohibition now applies\u2014at a minimum\u2014to all information from all computers that \nconnect to the Internet. \u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2)(C), (e)(2)(B). \nThose who violate \u00a71030(a)(2) face penalties ranging from\nfines and misdemeanor sentences to imprisonment for up to10 years. \u00a71030(c)(2). They also risk civil liability under \nthe CFAA\u2019s private cause of action, which allows persons \nsuffering \u201cdamage\u201d or \u201closs\u201d fr om CFAA violations to sue for \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  3 Cite as: 593 U.

In the course of his duties, Van Buren \ncrossed paths with a man named Andrew Albo. The deputy\nchief of Van Buren\u2019s department considered Albo to be \u201cvery\nvolatile\u201d and warned officers in  the department to deal with\nhim carefully. Notwithstanding that warning, Van Buren \ndeveloped a friendly relationship with Albo.  Or so Van Bu -\nren thought when he went to Albo  to ask for a personal loan. \nUnbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo  secretly recorded that re -\nquest and took it to the local sheriff \u2019s office, where he com -\nplained that Van Buren had sought to \u201cshake him down\u201d for cash. \nThe taped conversation made its way to the Federal Bu-\nreau of Investigation (FBI), which devised an operation to see how far Van Buren would go for money.  The steps were \nstraightforward: Albo would ask Van Buren to search the \nstate law enforcement computer database for a license plate\npurportedly belonging to a woman whom Albo had met at a\nlocal strip club. Albo, no stranger to legal troubles, wouldtell Van Buren that he wanted to ensure that the woman \nwas not in fact an undercover o fficer.  In return for the \nsearch, Albo would pay Van Buren around $5,000.\nThings went according to plan.  Van Buren used his \npatrol-car computer to access the law enforcement database \nwith his valid credentials.  He searched the database for the \nlicense plate that Albo had provided.  After obtaining the \nFBI-created license-plate entry , Van Buren told Albo that \nhe had information to share. \nThe Federal Government then charged Van Buren with a\nfelony violation of the CFAA on the ground that running the \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  4 VAN BUREN v.

Van Buren therefore knew \nthat the search breached department policy. And according\nto the Government, that violat ion of department policy also \nviolated the CFAA. Consistent  with that position, the Gov-\nernment told the jury that Van Buren\u2019s access of the data -\nbase \u201cfor a non[- ]law[-]enforcement purpose\u201d violated the\nCFAA \u201cconcept\u201d against \u201cusing\u201d a computer network in a \nway contrary to \u201cwhat your job or policy prohibits.\u201d  Id., at \n39. The jury convicted Van Buren, and the District Court\nsentenced him to 18 months in prison.\nVan Buren appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, arguing\nthat the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause applies only to\nthose who obtain information to which their computer ac -\ncess does not extend, not to those who misuse access that \nthey otherwise have. While several Circuits see the clause Van Buren\u2019s way, the Eleventh Circuit is among those that\nhave taken a broader view.\n2 Consistent with its Circuit \nprecedent, the panel held that Van Buren had violated the\nCFAA by accessing the law enforcement database for an\u201cinappropriate reason.\u201d  940 F. 3d 1192, 1208 (2019).

S. ___ (2020). \nII \nA \n1 \nBoth Van Buren and the Government raise a host of pol-\nicy arguments to support their respective interpretations.\nBut we start where we always do: with the text of the stat-\nute. Here, the most relevant text is the phrase \u201cexceeds au-\nthorized access,\u201d which means \u201cto access a computer withauthorization and to use such access to obtain . . . infor-\nmation in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so\nto obtain.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6).\nThe parties agree that Van Buren \u201caccess[ed] a computer\nwith authorization\u201d when he used his patrol-car computerand valid credentials to log into the law enforcement data-\nbase.  They also agree that Van Buren \u201cobtain[ed] . . . infor-\nmation in the computer\u201d when he acquired the license-plate \nrecord for Albo.  The dispute is whether Van Buren was \u201cen-\ntitled so to obtain\u201d the record. \n\u201cEntitle\u201d means \u201cto give . . . a title, right, or claim to\nsomething.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-guage 649 (2d ed. 1987).  See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n477 (5th ed. 1979) (\u201cto give a right or legal title to\u201d).  The \nparties agree that Van Buren had been given the right to acquire license-plate information\u2014that is, he was \u201centitled \nto obtain\u201d it\u2014from the law enforcement computer database. \nBut was Van Buren \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d the license-plate\ninformation, as the statute requires? \nVan Buren says yes. He notes that \u201cso,\u201d as used in this \nstatute, serves as a term of reference that recalls \u201cthe same \nmanner as has been stated\u201d or \u201cthe way or manner de-\nscribed.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 1246; 15 Oxford Eng-\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 6 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nlish Dictionary 887 (2d ed. 1989).  The disputed phrase \u201cen-\ntitled so to obtain\u201d thus asks whether one has the right, in\n\u201cthe same manner as has been stated,\u201d to obtain the rele-vant information.  And the only manner of obtaining infor-\nmation already stated in the definitional provision is \u201cvia a \ncomputer [one] is otherwise authorized to access.\u201d  Reply\nBrief 3. Putting that together, Van Buren contends that the \ndisputed phrase\u2014\u201cis not entitled so to obtain\u201d\u2014plainly re-\nfers to information one is not allowed to obtain by using a \ncomputer that he is authorized to access. On this reading, ifa person has access to information stored in a computer\u2014 \ne.g., in \u201cFolder Y,\u201d from which the person could permissibly \npull information\u2014then he does not violate the CFAA by ob-\ntaining such information, regardless of whether he pulled\nthe information for a prohibited purpose. But if the infor-mation is instead located in prohibited \u201cFolder X,\u201d to which\nthe person lacks access, he violates the CFAA by obtaining \nsuch information. \nThe Government agrees that the statute uses \u201cso\u201d in the \nword\u2019s term-of-reference sense, but it argues that \u201cso\u201d sweeps more broadly.  It reads the phrase \u201cis not entitled so \nto obtain\u201d to refer to informat ion one was not allowed to ob-\ntain in the particular manner or circumstances in which he \nobtained it .  The manner or circumstances in which one has \na right to obtain information, the Government says, are de-\nfined by any \u201cspecifically and  explicitly\u201d communicated lim-\nits on one\u2019s right to access information.  Brief for United \nStates 19. As the Government sees it, an employee might\nlawfully pull information from Folder Y in the morning for \na permissible purpose\u2014say, to prepare for a business meet-\ning\u2014but unlawfully pull the same information from Folder \nY in the afternoon for a prohibited purpose\u2014say, to help draft a resume to submit to a competitor employer. \nThe Government\u2019s interpretation has surface appeal but\nproves to be a sleight of hand.

Under the Gove rnment\u2019s approach, the rele-\nvant circumstance\u2014the one rendering a person\u2019s conduct illegal\u2014is not identified earlier in the statute.  Instead, \u201cso\u201d captures any circumstance-based limit appearing any-\nwhere \u2014in the United States Code, a state statute, a private\nagreement, or anywhere else. And while the Government \ntries to cabin its interpretation by suggesting that any such\nlimit must be \u201cspecifically and  explicitly\u201d stated, \u201cexpress,\u201d \nand \u201cinherent in the authorization itself,\u201d the Government does not identify any textual basis for these guardrails.

It refers to a stated, \nidentifiable proposition from the \u201cpreceding\u201d text; indeed, \n\u201cso\u201d typically \u201c[r]epresent[s]\u201d a \u201cword or phrase already em-ployed,\u201d thereby avoiding the need for repetition.  15 Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary, at 887; see Webster\u2019s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 2160 (1986) (so \u201coften used as a substi-\ntute . . . to express the idea of a preceding phrase\u201d).

Recall the definition: \u201cto access a comp uter with authorization and \nto use such access to obtain . . . information in the computer\nthat the accesser is not entitled so to obtain.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6)\n(emphasis added). According to  the Government, \u201cso\u201d adds\nnothing to the sentence if it refers solely to the earlier\nstated manner of obtaining the information through use ofa computer one has accessed with authorization.  What \nmatters on Van Buren\u2019s reading, as the Government sees \nit, is simply that the person obtain information that he is\nnot entitled to obtain\u2014and t hat point could be made even \nif \u201cso\u201d were deleted. By co ntrast, the Government insists, \n\u201cso\u201d makes a valuable contribution if it incorporates all of the circumstances that might qualify a person\u2019s right to ob-\ntain information. Because only its interpretation gives \u201cso\u201d \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nother property to have been so embezz led, stolen, [or] converted . . . re -\ntains the same with intent to convert it to his use,\u201d is subject to punish-ment); \u00a71708 (\u201c[W]hoever steals, takes,  or abstracts, or by fraud or de-\nception obtains, or attempts so to obtain,\u201d parcels of mail is subject to\npunishment). \n4The dissent criticizes this interpretation as inconsistent with \u201cbasic \nprinciples of property law,\u201d and in pa rticular the \u201cfamiliar rule that an \nentitlement to use another person\u2019s pr operty is circumstance specific.\u201d \nPost, at 4\u20135 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.).  But common-law principles \u201cshould\nbe imported into statutory text only when Congress employs a common-\nlaw term\u201d\u2014not when Congress has out lined an offense \u201canalogous to a \ncommon-law crime without using common-law terms.\u201d  Carter v. United \nStates, 530 U. S. 255, 265 (2000) (emphasis deleted).  Relying on the com-mon law is particularly ill advised here  because it was the failure of pre -\nexisting law to capture computer crime  that helped spur Congress to en-\nact the CFAA.

S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at \n10).\nBut the canon does not help the Government because Van\nBuren\u2019s reading does not render \u201cso\u201d superfluous.  As Van \nBuren points out, without \u201cso,\u201d the statute would allow in-\ndividuals to use their right to obtain information in nondig-ital form as a defense to CFAA liability.  Consider, for ex -\nample, a person who downloads restricted personnel fileshe is not entitled to obtain by using his computer. Such a \nperson could argue that he was \u201centitled to obtain\u201d the in-\nformation if he had the right to access personnel files through another method ( e.g., by requesting hard copies of\nthe files from human resources). With \u201cso,\u201d the CFAA fore -\ncloses that theory of defense. The statute is concerned with \nwhat a person does on a computer; it does not excuse hack-\ning into an electronic personnel file if the hacker could have\nwalked down the hall to pick up a physical copy.\nThis clarification is signif icant because it underscores \nthat one kind of entitlement to information counts: the right\nto access the information by using a computer. That can \nexpand liability, as the above example shows.  But it nar-rows liability too. Without the word \u201cso,\u201d the statute could \nbe read to incorporate all kinds of limitations on one\u2019s enti-\ntlement to information. The dissent\u2019s take on the statute \nillustrates why. \n3 \nWhile the dissent accepts Van Buren\u2019s definition of \u201cso,\u201d\nit would arrive at the Govern ment\u2019s result by way of the \nword \u201centitled.\u201d  One is \u201centitled\u201d to do something, the dis-sent contends, only when \u201c \u2018proper grounds\u2019 \u201d are in place. \nPost, at 3 (opinion of T\nHOMAS , J.)

This reading, like the Govern-\nment\u2019s, would extend the statute\u2019s reach to any \ncircumstance-based limit appearing anywhere. \nThe dissent\u2019s approach to the word \u201centitled\u201d fares fine in \nthe abstract but poorly in context.  The statute does not re-\nfer to \u201cinformation . . . that the accesser is not entitled to \nobtain.\u201d It refers to \u201cinformation . . . that the accesser is not \nentitled so to obtain.\u201d  18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis \nadded). The word \u201centitled,\u201d then, does not stand alone, in -\nviting the reader to consider the full scope of the accesser\u2019s\nentitlement to information.  The modifying phrase \u201cso to ob-tain\u201d directs the reader to consider a specific limitation on \nthe accesser\u2019s entitlement: his entitlement to obtain the in-\nformation \u201cin the manner previously stated.\u201d Supra,  at 7. \nAnd as already explained, the manner previously stated isusing a computer one is authorized to access. Thus, while \ngiving lipservice to Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso,\u201d the dissent, \nlike the Government, declines to give \u201cso\u201d any limiting func-\ntion.\n5 \nThe dissent cannot have it both ways.  The consequence\nof accepting Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso\u201d is the narrowedscope of \u201centitled.\u201d In fact, th e dissent\u2019s examples implicitly\nconcede as much: They all omit the word \u201cso,\u201d thereby giv-ing \u201centitled\u201d its full sweep.  See post, at 3\u20134.  An approach\nthat must rewrite the statute to work is even less persua-\nsive than the Government\u2019s. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5For the same reason, the dissent is incorrect when it contends that \nour interpretation reads the additional words \u201cunder any possible cir-\ncumstance\u201d into the statute.  Post, at 3 (emphasis deleted).  Our reading\ninstead interprets the phrase \u201cso to obtain\u201d to incorporate the single \u201ccir-cumstance\u201d of permissible informatio n access identified by the statute:\nobtaining the information by using one\u2019s computer. \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n 11 Cite as: 593 U.

According to \nthe Government, any ordinary speaker of the English lan-\nguage would think that Van Buren \u201cexceed[ed] his author-\nized access\u201d to the law enforcement database when he ob-\ntained license-plate information for personal purposes.

Post, at 9. \nIf the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d were all we had\nto go on, the Government and the dissent might have a \npoint.

The \u201cwithout authoriza-\ntion\u201d clause, Van Buren contends, protects computers them-selves by targeting so-called outside hackers\u2014those who \n\u201cacces[s] a computer without any permission at all.\u201d LVRC \nHoldings LLC v. Brekka , 581 F. 3d 1127, 1133 (CA9 2009); \nsee also Pulte Homes, Inc. v. Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of North \nAm., 648 F. 3d 295, 304 (CA6 2011).  Van Buren reads the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause to provide complemen-\ntary protection for certain information within computers.  It does so, Van Buren asserts, by  targeting so-called inside \nhackers\u2014those who access a computer with permission, but then \u201c \u2018exceed\u2019 the parameters of authorized access by en-\ntering an area of the computer to which [that] authorization does not extend.\u201d  United States v. Valle , 807 F. 3d 508, 524 \n(CA2 2015).\nVan Buren\u2019s account of subsection (a)(2) makes sense of\nthe statutory structure because it treats the \u201cwithout au -\nthorization\u201d and \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clauses con -\nsistently. Under Van Buren\u2019s reading, liability under both clauses stems from a gates-up-or-down inquiry\u2014one either \ncan or cannot access a computer system, and one either can\nor cannot access certain areas within the system.\n8  A n d \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8For present purposes, we need not address whether th is inquiry turns\nonly on technological (or \u201ccode-based\u201d)  limitations on access, or instead\nalso looks to limits contained in cont racts or policies.

See supra, at 11\u201312.9 \nBy contrast, the Government\u2019s reading of the \u201cexceeds au -\nthorized access\u201d clause creates \u201cinconsistenc[ies] with thedesign and structure\u201d of subsection (a)(2). University of \nTex. Southwestern Medical Center  v. Nassar , 570 U. S. 338, \n353 (2013).  As discussed, the Government reads the \u201cex-\nceeds authorized access\u201d clause to incorporate purpose-\nbased limits contained in contracts and workplace policies. Yet the Government does not read such limits into the \nthreshold question whether someone uses a computer \n\u201cwithout authorization\u201d\u2014even though similar purpose re-\nstrictions, like a rule against personal use, often govern \none\u2019s right to access a computer in the first place.  See, e.g., Royal Truck & Trailer Sales & Serv ., Inc. v. Kraft , 974 F. 3d \n756, 757 (CA6 2020). Thus, the Government proposes to read the first phrase \u201cwithout  authorization\u201d as a gates-up-\nor-down inquiry and the second phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as one that depends on the circumstances.  The Gov-ernment does not explain why the statute would prohibit \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9Van Buren\u2019s gates-up-or-down reading also aligns with the CFAA\u2019s\nprohibition on password trafficking. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. Enacted \nalongside the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d definition in 1986, the pass-\nword-trafficking provision bars the sale  of \u201cany password or similar in -\nformation through which a computer  may be accessed without authori-\nzation.\u201d \u00a71030(a)(6). The provision thus contemplates a \u201cspecific type of \nauthorization\u2014that is, authentication ,\u201d which turns on whether a user\u2019s \ncredentials allow him to proceed past a computer\u2019s access gate, rather than on other, scope-based restrict ions.  Bellia, A Code-Based Approach \nto Unauthorized Access Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 84\nGeo. Wash. L. Rev. 1442, 1470 (2016); cf. A Dictionary of Computing, at30 (defining \u201cauthorization\u201d as a \u201cprocess by which users, having com-pleted an . . . authentication stage, ga in or are denied access to particular\nresources based on their entitlement\u201d). \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 15 Cite as: 593 U.

Recall that violating \u00a71030(a)(2), the provision under\nwhich Van Buren was charged, also gives rise to civil liabil-\nity. See \u00a71030(g). Provisions defining \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d \nspecify what a plaintiff in a civil suit can recover. \n\u201c\u2018[D]amage,\u2019 \u201d the statute provides, means \u201cany impairment \nto the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system,\nor information.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(8).  The term \u201closs\u201d likewise re-\nlates to costs caused by harm to computer data, programs, systems, or information servic es.  \u00a71030(e)(11). The statu-\ntory definitions of \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d thus focus on tech-nological harms\u2014such as the corruption of files\u2014of the \ntype unauthorized users cause to computer systems and \ndata. Limiting \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d in this way makes sense in a scheme \u201caimed at preventing the typical conse-\nquences of hacking.\u201d Royal Truck , 974 F. 3d, at 760.  The \nterm\u2019s definitions are ill fitted, however, to remediating \u201cmisuse\u201d of sensitive information that employees may per-\nmissibly access using their computers. Ibid.

Doing so, the \ndissent contends, would reflect that \u201c[p]roperty law generally protects \nagainst both unlawful entry and unlawful use.\u201d  Post, at 7.  This inter -\npretation suffers from structural pr oblems of its own.  Consider the \nstandard rule prohibiting the use of  one\u2019s work computer for personal \npurposes. Under the dissent\u2019s approa ch, an employee\u2019s computer access \nwould be without authorization if he logged on  to the computer with the \npurpose of obtaining a file for personal reasons.  In that  event, obtaining \nthe file would not violate the \u201cexceed s authorized access\u201d clause, which \napplies only when one accesses a computer \u201c with authorization.\u201d \n\u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis added).  The dissent\u2019s reading would therefore leave the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d cl ause with no work to do much of \nthe time\u2014an outcome that Van Buren\u2019s interpretation (and, for that\nmatter, the Government\u2019s) avoids. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 16 VAN BUREN v.

These arguments are easily dispatched. \nAs for precedent, the Government asserts that this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Musacchio  v. United States, 577 U. S. \n237 (2016), bolsters its reading.  There, in addressing a \nquestion about the standard of review for instructional er-\nror, the Court described \u00a71030(a)(2) as prohibiting \u201c(1) ob -\ntaining access without authorization; and (2) obtaining ac-cess with authorization but then using that access improperly.\u201d Id., at 240. This paraphrase of the statute\ndoes not do much for the Government.  As an initial matter, Musacchio did not address\u2014much less resolve in the Gov-\nernment\u2019s favor\u2014the \u201cpoint now at issue,\u201d and we thus \u201care not bound to follow\u201d any dicta in the case. Central Va. Com-\nmunity College v. Katz , 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006).  But in \nany event, Van Buren\u2019s interpretation, no less than the Government\u2019s, involves \u201cusing [one\u2019s] access improperly.\u201d \nIt is plainly \u201cimproper\u201d for one to use the opportunity his\ncomputer access provides to ob tain prohibited information \nfrom within the computer.\nAs for statutory history, the Government claims that the\noriginal 1984 Act supports its interpretation of the current \nversion. In a precursor to the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d\nclause, the 1984 Act covered any person who, \u201chaving ac -\ncessed a computer with authorization, uses the opportunity such access provides for purposes to which such authoriza-tion does not extend,\u201d and thus expressly alluded to the pur-\npose of an insider\u2019s computer access.  18 U.

UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \notherwise law-abiding citizens are criminals. Take the \nworkplace. Employers commonly state that computers and \nelectronic devices can be used only for business purposes. \nSo on the Government\u2019s reading of the statute, an employee\nwho sends a personal e-mail or reads the news using her \nwork computer has violated the CFAA.  Or consider the In-\nternet. Many websites, services, and databases\u2014which \nprovide \u201cinformation\u201d from \u201cprotected computer[s],\u201d\u00a71030(a)(2)(C)\u2014authorize a user\u2019s access only upon his \nagreement to follow specified terms of service. If the \u201cex-\nceeds authorized access\u201d clause encompasses violations of circumstance-based access restrictions on employers\u2019 com-\nputers, it is difficult to see why it would not also encompass\nviolations of such restrictions  on website providers\u2019 comput-\ners. And indeed, numerous amici explain why the Govern-\nment\u2019s reading of subsection (a)(2) would do just that\u2014criminalize everything from embellishing an online-dating \nprofile to using a pseudonym on Facebook.

UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo can be thin on the Government\u2019s reading. Because \npurpose-based limits on access are often designed with an \neye toward information misuse, they can be expressed aseither access or use restrictions.  For example, one police \ndepartment might prohibit using a confidential database\nfor a non-law-enforcement purpose (an access restriction),while another might prohibit using information from the \ndatabase for a non-law-enforcement purpose (a use re-striction). Conduct like Van Buren\u2019s can be characterized \neither way, and an employer might not see much difference between the two. On the Gove rnment\u2019s reading, however,\nthe conduct would violate the CFAA only if the employer phrased the policy as an access restriction.  An interpreta -\ntion that stakes so much on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of private parties is hard to sell as themost plausible. \nIV \nIn sum, an individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d when \nhe accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014that are off limits to \nhim. The parties agree that Van Buren accessed the law enforcement database system with authorization.  The onlyquestion is whether Van Buren could use the system to re -\ntrieve license-plate information. Both sides agree that he \ncould. Van Buren accordingly did not \u201cexcee[d] authorized \naccess\u201d to the database, as the CFAA defines that phrase, \neven though he obtained information from the database foran improper purpose. We therefore reverse the contrary\njudgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for \nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n _________________ \n_________________ 1 Cite as: 593 U.

The problem for the majority\nview, however, is that the text, ordinary principles of prop-\nerty law, and statutory history establish that the defini-\ntional provision is quite consiste nt with the term it defines. \nI \nA \nThe Act defines \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as \u201cto access \na computer with authorization and to use such access to ob -\ntain or alter information in the computer that the accesser\nis not entitled so to obtain or alter.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6). For pur-poses of this appeal, it is agreed that Van Buren was au -\nthorized to log into a government database and that he usedhis entry to obtain fake license -plate information from that \ndatabase. I thus agree with the majority that this case turns on whether Van Buren was \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d the fake license-plate information. I also agree that \u201cso\u201d asks\nwhether Van Buren had a right to obtain that information \nthrough the means identified earlier in the definition: (1) \naccessing a computer with authorization and (2) using that \naccess to obtain information in the computer.  In other words, Van Buren\u2019s conduct was legal only if he was enti-\ntled to obtain that specific license-plate information by us-\ning his admittedly authorized access to the database.\nHe was not.

Everyone agrees that he obtained it for \npersonal gain, not for a valid law enforcement purpose.  And \nwithout a valid law enforcement purpose, he was forbidden \nto use the computer to obtain that information. \nB \nThe majority postulates an alternative reading of this\ndefinitional provision: So long as a person is entitled to use a computer to obtain information in at least one circum-\nstance, this statute does not apply even if the person ob -\ntains the data outside that circumstance.  In effect, the ma-\njority reads the statute to apply only when a person is \u201cnot\nentitled [ under any possible circumstance ] so to obtain\u201d in-\nformation.  This interpretati on is flawed for a number of \nreasons. \n1 \nForemost, that interpretation is contrary to the plain \nmeaning of the text.  Entitlements are necessarily circum-\nstance dependent; a person is entitled to do something only\nwhen \u201cproper grounds\u201d or facts are in place.  Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 477.   Focusing on the word \u201cso,\u201d the majority\nlargely avoids analyzing the term  \u201centitled,\u201d concluding at \nthe outset in a single sentence that Van Buren was entitled \nto obtain this license-plate information.  Ante , at 5. But the \nplain meaning of \u201centitled\u201d comp els the opposite conclusion. \nBecause Van Buren lacked a law enforcement purpose, the\u201cproper grounds\u201d did not exist.  He was not entitled to ob-tain the data when he did so. \nA few real-world scenarios illustrate the point.  An em-\nployee who is entitled to pull the alarm in the event of a fire\nis not entitled to pull it for some other purpose, such as to\ndelay a meeting for which he is unprepared. A valet who obtains a car from a restaurant patron is\u2014to borrow the\nlanguage from \u00a71030(e)(6)\u2014\u201centitled\u201d to \u201caccess [the car]\u201d \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 VAN BUREN v.

See, \ne.g., Ind. Code \u00a735\u201343\u20134\u20133 (2020) (felonious criminal con-\nversion to \u201cknowingly or inte ntionally exer[t] unauthorized \ncontrol over property of another\u201d if \u201cthe property is a motor \nvehicle\u201d); In re Clayton , 778 N. E. 2d 404, 405 (Ind. 2002) \n(interpreting this statute to co ver misuse of property a per-\nson otherwise is entitled to access).  And, to take an exam -\nple closer to this statute, an employee of a car rental com-\npany may be \u201centitled\u201d to \u201caccess a computer\u201d showing the\nGPS location history of a rent al car and \u201cuse such access\u201d\nto locate the car if it is reported stolen.  But it would be unnatural to say he is \u201centitled\u201d to \u201cuse such access\u201d to stalk his ex-girlfriend.\nThe majority offers no real response.  It notes that \u201centi -\ntled\u201d is modified by \u201cso\u201d and that courts must therefore con-\nsider whether a person is entitled to use a computer to ob-\ntain information. Ante , at 10.  But if a person is not entitled \nto obtain information at all , it necessarily follows that he\nhas no \u201cright to access the information by using a com-puter.\u201d Ante, at 9. Van Buren was not entitled to obtain \nthis information at all bec ause the condition precedent \nneeded to trigger an entitlement\u2014a law enforcement pur-\npose\u2014was absent. \n2 \nNext, the majority\u2019s reading is  at odds with basic princi-\nples of property law.  By now,  it is well established that in-\nformation contained in a comput er is \u201cproperty.\u201d  Nobody\ndoubts, for example, that a movie stored on a computer is \nintellectual property.  Federa l and state law routinely de-\nfine \u201cproperty\u201d to include computer data.  E.g.,  12 U. S. C. \n\u00a75433; N. Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7155.00 (West 2010).  And even the majority acknowledges  that this statute is de-\nsigned to protect property. Ante , at 2.

When a person is authorized to enter\nland and entitled to use that entry for one purpose but does\nso for another, he trespasses. As the Second Restatement \nof Torts explains, \u201c[a] condit ional or restricted consent to\nenter land creates a privilege to do so only in so far as the condition or restriction is complied with.\u201d \u00a7168, p. 311 \n(1964). The Restatement includes a helpful illustration: \n\u201c3. A grants permission to B, his neighbor, to enter\nA\u2019s land, and draw water from A\u2019s spring for B\u2019s own \nuse. A has specifically refused permission to C to enter\nA\u2019s land and draw water from the spring.  At C\u2019s insti-\ngation, B enters A\u2019s land and obtains for C water from \nthe spring. B\u2019s entry is a trespass.\u201d Ibid., Comment b . \nWhat is true for land is also true in the computer context;\nif a company grants permission to an employee to use a computer for a specific purpose, the employee has no au-\nthority to use it for other purposes.  \nConsider, too, the common understanding of theft. A per-\nson who is authorized to possess property for a limited pur -\npose commits theft the moment  he \u201cexercises unlawful con-\ntrol over\u201d it, which occurs \u201cwhenever consent or authorityis exceeded.\u201d ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7223.2(1), pp. 162, 168 \n(1980). To again borrow the language from \u00a71030(e)(6), a police officer may have authori ty to \u201caccess\u201d the depart -\nment\u2019s bank account and \u201cuse such access\u201d to cover law en -\nforcement expenses, but he is nonetheless guilty of embez-\nzlement if he \u201cuses such access\u201d to line his pockets.  He \nwould not be exonerated simply because he would be \u201centi-tled so to obtain\u201d funds from the account under other cir -\ncumstances. \nOr take bailment. A bailee commits conversion\u2014which \nmany jurisdictions criminalize\u2014when he, \u201chaving no au-thority to use the thing bailed, nonetheless uses it, or, hav-\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n 6 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \ning authority to use it in a particular way, uses it in a dif-ferent way.\u201d  8 C. J. S., Bailments \u00a743, pp. 480\u2013481 (2017) \n(footnote omitted). A computer technician may have au-thority to access a celebrity\u2019s computer to recover data from\na crashed hard drive, but not to use his access to copy and \nleak to the press photos st ored on that computer.  \nThe majority makes no attempt to square its interpreta-\ntion with this familiar principle.  Instead, it sweeps away this context by stating that Congress did not include in this \nstatute any common-law terms.  Ante, at 8, n. 4.  But the \nstatute does use words like \u201cexceed\u201d and \u201cauthority\u201d that\nare common to other property contexts.  And the majority never identifies any particular property-law buzzwords that it thinks Congress was obliged to include. \nThe majority next says that relying on pre-existing con -\ncepts of property law is \u201cill advised\u201d because Congress en-\nacted this law in light of a \u201cfailure of pre-existing law to\ncapture computer crime.\u201d  Ante,  at 2, 8, n. 4 (citing Kerr,\nCybercrime\u2019s Scope: Interpre ting \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAuthoriza -\ntion\u201d in Computer Misuse Statutes, 78 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1596 (2003)). Yet the reasons why pre-existing law was consid-\nered inadequate undermine the majority\u2019s position.  First, \nstate laws were used to cover conduct like Van Buren\u2019s, but \ndoing so \u201crequire[d] considerable creativity\u201d because thoselaws typically required either \u201cphysical\u201d entry (which fit\npoorly with computers) or \u201cdepriv[ing]\u201d a victim of property\n(which fit poorly where a person \u201cmerely copied\u201d data or en-\ngaged in forbidden \u201cpersonal uses\u201d).  Id., at 1607\u20131608, \n1610\u20131611. Second, the fit was even more awkward for fed-eral laws, which were \u201cmore limited in scope.\u201d Id., at 1608. \nCongress did not enact this law to eliminate the established principle that entitlements to use property are circum-stance specific, but instead to eliminate the deprivation and \nphysical-entry requirements.    \nUnable to square its interpretation with established prin-\n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 593 U. S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nciples of property law, the majority contends that its inter -\npretation is more harmonious with a separate clause in the\nstatute that forbids \u201caccess[ing] a computer without author-ization.\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2). In the majority\u2019s telling, this clause\nrequires \u201ca gates-up-or-down inquiry\u2014one either can or\ncannot access a computer system,\u201d so it makes sense to read \nthe \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause in the same sentence \nto include the same approach. Ante , at 13\u201314 . \nI agree that the two clauses should be read harmoniously,\nbut there is no reason to believe that if the gates are up ina single instance, then they must remain up indefinitely.\nAn employee who works with sensitive defense information \nmay generally have authority to log into his employer-is-sued laptop while away from the office.  But if his employer\ninstructs him not to log in while on a trip to a country where \nnetwork connections cannot be trusted, he accesses the \ncomputer without authorization if he logs in anyway.  For \nboth clauses, discerning whether the gates are up or downrequires considering the circumstances that cause the gates \nto move. \nIn fact, my reading harmonizes both clauses with estab-\nlished concepts of property law.  Property law generally pro-\ntects against both unlawful entry and unlawful use after \nentry. E.g.,  Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7214, Comment \ne, at 408\u2013409; 8 C. J. S., Bailments \u00a743, at 480\u2013481.  The \nsame is true here. The police department could protect in-\nformation by prohibiting officers from logging in with an\nimproper purpose, but that would do little good if an officer \nlogged in at the start of his shift with proper intent and\nthen, hours later while still logged in, conducted license-plate searches in exchange for payment.  By including both\nthe \u201cwithout authorization\u201d and \u201cexceeds authorized ac-\ncess\u201d clauses, Congress ensured protection against im-\nproper login as well as misuse after proper login. \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \n3 \nThe majority\u2019s interpretation\u2014that criminality turns on\nwhether there is a single  exception to a prohibition\u2014also \nleads to awkward results.  Under its reading, an employee\nat a credit-card company who is forbidden to obtain the pur -\nchasing history of clients violates the Act when he obtains that data about his ex-wife\u2014unless his employer tells him\nhe can obtain and transfer purchase history data when anaccount has been flagged for possible fraudulent activity.\nThe same is true of the person who, minutes before resign-ing, deletes every file on a computer.  See Royal Truck & \nTrailer Sales & Serv.,  Inc. v. Kraft , 974 F. 3d 756, 758 (CA6 \n2020). So long as an employee could obtain or alter eachfile in some hypothetical circumstance, he is immune. But \nthe person who plays a round of solitaire is a criminal under \nthe majority\u2019s reading if his employer, concerned about dis-\ntractions, categorically prohibits accessing the \u201cgames\u201d\nfolder in Windows. It is an odd interpretation to \u201cstak[e] so \nmuch\u201d on the presence or absence of a single exception. \nAnte , at 20. \nThe majority\u2019s interpretation is especially odd when ap -\nplied to other clauses in the statute. Section 1030(a)(1) pro-hibits \u201cexceeding authorized a ccess\u201d to obtain \u201crestricted \ndata . . . with reason to believe that such information so ob-tained could be used to the injury of the United States, orto the advantage of any foreign nation,\u201d and retaining or \ndistributing that data.  The te rm \u201crestricted data\u201d is defined \nto include \u201call data concerning (1) design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72014(y).  Under \nthe majority\u2019s reading, so long as a scientist may obtain blueprints for atomic weapons in at least one circumstance, \nhe would be immune if he obtained that data for the im-proper purpose of helping an unfriendly nation build a nu-\nclear arsenal. It is difficult to see what force this provi-\nsion\u2014in place in substantially similar form since 1984\u2014has under the majority\u2019s reading. \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 593 U. S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \n4 \nWere there any remaining doubt about which interpreta-\ntion better fits the statute, the defined term settles it. \nWhen a definition is susceptible of more than one reading, \nthe one that best matches the plain meaning of the defined \nterm ordinarily controls. See, e.g., Bond v. United States , \n572 U. S. 844, 861 (2014) (considering the \u201cordinary mean-ing of a defined term\u201d); id., at 870 (Scalia, J., concurring in \njudgment) (courts may \u201cus[e] the ordinary meaning of the \nterm being defined for the purpose of resolving an ambigu-\nity in the definition\u201d (emphasis deleted)). That is because \n\u201cthere is a presumption against\u201d reading a provision con -\ntrary to the ordinary meaning of the term it defines. A. \nScalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Le-\ngal Texts 232 (2012); see also id., at 228 (\u201c[T]he meaning of \nthe definition is almost always closely related to the ordi-nary meaning of the word being defined\u201d).\nThe majority instead resolves supposed ambiguity in the \ndefinition against  the plain meaning of the defined term.  It \nadopts a \u201cfavor[ed]\u201d interpretation of the definition and \nthen asks whether the defined term can be interpreted in a \nway \u201cconsistent\u201d with this \u201cfavor[ed]\u201d view. Ante , at 11. \nBut \u201c[i]t should take the strongest evidence to make us be -\nlieve that Congress has defined a term in a manner repug-\nnant to its ordinary and traditional sense.\u201d Babbitt v. Sweet \nHome Chapter , Communities for Great Ore. , 515 U. S. 687, \n719 (1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The majority identifiesno such evidence. The most it says is that my reading of \n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d is not \u201cnecessarily\u201d best be-\ncause \u201caccess\u201d can have a technical meaning: entering thecomputer system or a part of the computer system. Ante , at \n11, 12, n. 6.  But whatever meaning \u201caccess\u201d might have,\n\u201cauthority\u201d\u2014like \u201centitled\u201d\u2014is circumstance dependent. \nThe majority\u2019s reading of \u201cacce ss\u201d confirms that point.  The \ndefinitions the majority cites reference not mere entry, but \nusing  entry to obtain specific data.  Ante,  at 12, n. 6. That \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n  \n 10 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \naccords with the definition here, which regulates a person\u2019s\n\u201cuse\u201d of a computer after entering it.  \u00a71030(e)(6). Here, as \nin other contexts of property la w, a person\u2019s authority to use\nhis access to property is circumstance dependent.  The ma -\njority\u2019s focus on the term \u201caccess\u201d\u2014at the expense of \u201cau-thority\u201d and \u201centitled\u201d\u2014harms, not helps, its argument. \nII \nWhat the text and established concepts of property law\nmake clear, statutory history reinforces. The original text\nof this Act expressly prohibited accessing a computer with \nauthorization and then \u201cus[ing] the opportunity such accessprovides for purposes to which such authorization does not \nextend.\u201d 98 Stat. 2191.  The Act thus applied when persons\nused computers for improper reasons\u2014just like Van Buren \nindisputably did here.\nThe majority does not deny this. Instead, it notes that \nCongress amended the text in 198 6 to its present definition, \nand it says that the Court can presume that Congress\u2019 de-\ncision to omit the term \u201cpur pose\u201d necessarily eliminated\nany prohibition against obtaining information for an im-proper purpose. Ante , at 17. \nBut the majority cannot so easily evade this history.\nTrue, the statute previously included the term \u201cpurpose\u201dand now does not, but the majority fails to consider how \nthat change affected the statute. Often, deleting a word ex-\npands, rather than constricts, the scope of a provision.  If a \ncity changes a sign in a park from \u201cno unleashed dogs\u201d to \n\u201cno dogs,\u201d nobody would presume that unleashed dogs are now allowed. The same is true when the specific is replaced\nby the general (\u201cno dogs\u201d to \u201cno pets\u201d).\nCongress\u2019 change to this statute similarly broadened the\nlaw. The original text prohibited accessing a computer with\nauthorization then \u201cus[ing] the opportunity such access provides for purposes to which such authorization does not \nextend.\u201d The term \u201cpurpose\u201d limited that clause to purpose-\n   \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  11 Cite as: 593 U. S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nbased constraints. It did not naturally include other con-\nstraints, such as time and manner restrictions.  By replac -\ning the specific, limited term \u201cpurposes\u201d with the broader, \nmore general phrase \u201cnot enti tled,\u201d Congress gave force to\nthose other kinds of constraints.  Consider the previous ex-ample of the employee who violates an instruction not to log \nin while in an unfriendly foreig n country with insecure net-\nworks. The original text would not cover him, so long as he \nlogged in for a proper purpose like checking work e-mail. The newer text would cover him because his entitlement to \nobtain or alter data is context dependent.  His purpose isinnocent, but the time or manner of his use is not. \nIII \nThe majority ends with policy arguments.  It suggests\nthey are not needed.  Ante , at 17 (\u201c \u2018extra icing on a cake \nalready frosted\u2019 \u201d).  Yet, it stresses them at length.  Ante , at \n17\u201320. Regardless, the majority\u2019s reliance on these policy arguments is in error. \nConcerned about criminalizing a \u201cbreathtaking amount \nof commonplace computer activity,\u201d the majority says thatthe way people use computers today \u201cunderscores the im-\nplausibility of the Government\u2019s interpretation.\u201d  Ante , at \n17. But statutes are read according to their \u201c \u2018ordinary \nmeaning at the time Congress enacted the statute.\u2019 \u201d  Wis -\nconsin Central Ltd.  v. United States , 585 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 2) (ellipsis omitted).  The majority\u2019s reli -\nance on modern-day uses of computers to determine what \nwas plausible in the 1980s wrongly assumes that Congress\nin 1984 was aware of how computers would be used in 2021. \nI also would not so readily assume that my interpretation\nwould automatically cover so much conduct. Many provi -\nsions plausibly narrow the statute\u2019s reach.  For example, \nthe statute includes the strict mens rea requirement that a\nperson must \u201cintentionally . . . excee[d] authorized access.\u201d\u00a71030(a)(2). The statute thus might not apply if a person \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  12 VAN BUREN v. UNITED STATES \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nbelieves  he is allowed to use the computer a certain way be -\ncause, for example, that kind of behavior is common and \ntolerated. Cf. Restatement (S econd) of Contracts \u00a7223(2) \n(1979) (discussing how an establ ished \u201ccourse of dealing\u201d \ncan erase written limitations in certain contractual con-texts). The Act also concerns only \u201cobtain[ing] or alter[ing] \ninformation in the computer,\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis\nadded), not using the Internet to check sports scores stored \nin some distant server ( i.e., a different computer). The ma-\njority does not deny that many provisions plausibly narrow the focus of this statute.  It simply faults the government\nfor not arguing the point more forcefully.  Ante, at 18\u201319. I \nwould not give so much weight to the hypothetical concern that the Government might  start charging innocuous con-\nduct and that courts might  interpret the statute to cover \nthat conduct. \nThe majority\u2019s argument also proves too much. Much of \nthe Federal Code criminalizes common activity.  Absent ag -\ngravating factors, the penalty for violating this Act is a mis-\ndemeanor. \u00a71030(c)(2)(A). This Act thus penalizes mine-\nrun offenders about as harshly as federal law punishes a\nperson who removes a single grain of sand from the Na-tional Mall, 40 U. S. C. \u00a78103(b); breaks a lamp in a Gov-\nernment building, ibid.; or permits a horse to eat grass on\nfederal land, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71857.

Criminal Justice Faulty tests spur questions about DNA findings in criminal cases in Texas and nationally Texas Public Radio | By Paul Flahive Published\u00a0May 5, 2025 at 10:56 AM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Jim Young / ReutersDNA analysis Sign up for\u00a0TPR Today, Texas Public Radio's newsletter that brings our top stories to your inbox each morning.DNA tests for criminal cases across Texas are getting second looks from labs because one of the largest DNA test manufacturers globally told customers about issues with some tests distributed from February 2024 to October 2024.Officials at Qiagen, the multi-billion-dollar maker of DNA tests, alerted customers in Texas and Virginia that they received complaints that their EZ1&2 Investigator Kits were extracting less DNA than expected.Complaints reported that some tests incorrectly represented that not enough DNA existed to test, and others represented samples that had multiple people\u2019s DNA present as fewer or just one person\u2019s genetic material.Assessing the scope of the impact of affected tests was difficult to determine because Qiagen has not disclosed the total number of tests or where affected tests may have been sent.\u201cWe have received fewer than 10 complaints nationwide on this matter, and the number of kits involved has been well below 1% of annual manufacturing,\u201d said John Gilardi, vice president and head of corporate communications, in a statement.But Gilardi declined to say how many kits the company produces in a year. The company is one of the biggest providers in the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Peter Stout, president of the Houston Forensic Science Center (HFSC). \u201cThis is a product that almost everybody uses \u2026 all across the U.S., all across the world.\u201dQiagen declined to give TPR an interview because it was a public holiday in Europe but responded to some questions in writing. Officials said the tests met their internal quality control measures, and while the company recovered stock from labs, it was not a recall. Screengrab / Qiagen websiteQiagen EZ1&2 Investigator Kits The results, however, are leading forensic scientists in those labs to question if results are scientifically reliable.The Houston Forensic Science Center disclosed the intermittent problems it and other labs were having at an April 11 meeting of the Texas Forensic Science Commission. Texas is one of few states with a public agency overseeing how forensic science is used in courts.HFSC discovered the problems with the tests and brought it to the company\u2019s attention last year. Stout told the commission that the HFSC had several conversations with the company.In a letter to clients dated April 1, Qiagen said it made production changes at its factory to address the issue in October 2024 after alerting customers of the complaints.\u201cBased on the data available, there is no indication of a broader or systemic issue,\u201d said the letter.The tests used for dried blood, bone, semen, saliva, and trace DNA are largely for criminal prosecutions, meaning the stakes are high when errors occur.\u201cTexas is a death penalty state, many others are. Justice is a matter of life and death,\u201d said Michael Kessler, principal at Kessler Forensic Solutions, a company that consults on DNA analysis in trials.The affected tests at times fail to always produce a DNA profile when it is present.\u201cWe run the risk of missing a profile that could be potentially exonerating. We also run the risk of missing a profile that could be of importance for an investigation. So basically, you could think of the sexual assault kit that we don't get the profile of. The potential offender \u2026 they go un-arrested,\u201d Stout said.The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed that its Austin laboratory uses the tests, and it was reviewing 700 cases for next steps. The HFSC confirmed it will likely review hundreds more cases. But the impacts could be far greater nationwide, according to experts.\u201cI would think if they wanted to have an abundance of caution, they could go back now to case work samples, where they got \u2018no\u2019 results,\u201d said Dan Krane, professor at Wright University and consultant for forensic testing.That is if there is now enough material to test. \u201cA lot of these evidence samples are going to be low quantity. Swabs of gun cartridges, for instance, and they had one crack at it, and you just can't go back,\u201d he added.The costs of retesting will be incurred by the labs.The HFSC discovered the testing irregularities through its own quality assurance program. When officials reviewed the data, they saw a jump in the number of samples between June and August 2024 they sent out to contract labs coming back with so-called \u201cunintuitive results\u201d rising from about two samples to 45.\u201cThat's a 14% rate,\u201d Stout told the Texas Forensic Science Commission. \u201cThat stuck out.\u201dHFSC noted areas of improvement for Qiagen going forward in its presentation, including testing more of the cartridges. It found Qiagen tested only 36 cartridges per lot with an average size of 83,000. Statistically, it should have checked 235 cartridges for a 95% confidence rate, the HFSC presentation added.What makes any analysis difficult is that Qiagen declined to disclose to TPR how big its lot sizes were.Qiagen explained that it conducted a full investigation and that all the kits passed all the company\u2019s quality control standards.\u201cI think what's more concerning is the length of time over which this problem was occurring, the fact that the quality control program for the manufacturer did not catch the issue,\u201d said Elizabeth Daniel Vasquez, a former public defender who now consults for criminal defense teams on forensic science. Courtesy photo / Houston Forensic Science Center Qiagen cartridge The culprit for the issues was tentatively identified as the pH balance of one of the chemicals \u2014 the MTL buffer \u2014 used in the tests. HFSC noted other issues with cartridges \u2014 the long rectangular devices designed with numerous wells to hold components of the DNA testing process like chemicals. Upon visual inspection, scientists found a magnetic bead and specific chemicals in the wrong wells.It wasn\u2019t clear how many labs across Texas or nationally received the affected tests, but among them was the Department of Public Safety\u2019s offices in Austin as well as private testing labs Bode, based in Virginia, and Signature Science, based in Austin. Signature Science is a subsidiary of San Antonio\u2019s Southwest Research Institute.Two letters to labs reviewed by TPR showed that Signature Science and others were contacted by Qiagen in October 2024 about the issues.In a letter dated April 23, Signature Science told its clients that Qiagen failed to identify all affected lots and that its lab\u2019s DNA extraction work was also impacted this year.\u201cSignature Science believes any sample extracted between June 24, 2024, through February 28, 2025, that utilized EZ1&2 DNA Investigator reagent cartridge lots 178019172, 178026981, 178029201, or 178032040 may be impacted by this issue.,\u201d said Samantha Wandzek, technical leader for Signature Science, in a letter to clients obtained by TPR.Signature Science did not respond to TPR\u2019s requests for comment.In another letter obtained by TPR, Bode labs said it had internally tested the affected lots and \u201cit is unlikely that samples processed at Bode have been affected by this sporadic issue.\u201dQiagen said it has been responsive to labs\u2019 concerns. \u201cIn every case we\u2019ve worked directly with the lab to investigate the concern, perform follow-up testing and provide full support,\u201d Gilardi wrote in an email.But those assurances may not be enough for defense attorneys.\u201cWe're going to see a ton of cases where the impact of this is going to be directly clear,\u201d said Daniel Vasquez. \u201cI think more likely what we'll see is a whole lot of lack of evidence that nobody realizes was lost in the process.\u201d TPR was founded by and is supported by our community.

Judges\nPresented at the Texas State Capitol Auditorium on November 2, 2023\nForensic DNA Analysis \nThe goal of the presentation will be to introduce:\n1) What is DNA, where does DNA come from and \nwhat makes each of us unique\n2) What is forensic DNA analysis\n3) How is a genetic profile developed and what does \nit look like\n4) The basics of interpreting a genetic profile from a \nsingle contributor and from multiple contributors 1\n2\n10/31/2023\n2\nWhat is DNA?\n\u2022DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid ) is a \nchemical substance located in \nnucleus of every cell in your body \n(except red blood cells)\n\u2022DNA is inherited from your mother \nand father\n\u2022Its purpose is to instruct the body on \nhow to make proteins and serves as \na template for cellular reproduction\n\u2022DNA is the same in every cell of your \nbody \n\u2022DNA is unique to each person \n(except identical twins) and does \nnot change over a person\u2019s lifetime\nWhat is DNA?\n\u2022DNA is a long molecule \nconsisting of two strands \nwound together in the form \nof a double helix\n\u2022The strands are held \ntogether by the pairing of \nfour nucleotide bases \n(G,C,A,T) \n\u2022There are ~300 billion \nnucleotide bases in each \ncell making up the person\u2019s \nentire genome\n\u2022The sequence and number \nof nucleotide bases is what \nmakes each person unique3\n4\n10/31/2023\n3\nHow is DNA Packaged?\n\u2022DNA is packaged very tightly in \na structure called a \nchromosome\n\u2022The human body has 23 pairs of \nchromosomes\n\u2022One chromosome in the pair is \ninheritedfrom your mother and \nthe other chromosome in the \npair is inherited from your father\n\u2022One of the 23 pairs of \nchromosomes is called the sex \nchromosomes (XX or XY)\n\u2022Forensic DNA analysts use both \nthe sex chromosomes and the \nother 22 pairs of chromosomes \n(called autosomes) \nForensic DNA Analysis \n\u2022Forensic DNA analysis - developing a genetic profile from \nbiological material to help determine if someone may (or \nmay not) have been a possible donor of the DNA in the \nbiological sample\n\u2022Forensic DNA analysis does not indicate howthe \nbiological material was deposited on the item\n\u2022Forensic DNA analysis does not indicate whenthe \nbiological material was deposited on the item\n\u2022The questions of howand whenmay be inferred by the \ntrier of fact, but the forensic DNA analyst must exercise \ncaution if requested to comment on the hierarchy of \npropositions other than \u2018the (sub)source of the DNA\u20195\n6\n10/31/2023\n4\nHow are we

Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n7: 20240625164206282_24-06-25_Appendix_proc1_3.json (score: 0.692)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNo. _____ \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n29: 20240625164131272_24-06-25_CertPetition.json (score: 0.672)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNo. _____ \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed.

The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s highest \ncriminal court has already held should be the effect of such a decision. \nThe final step before adopting the proposed distinction is to see if it \nactually distinguishes Reed.  We start with what Reed argued at the Supreme \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA12\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n12 \nCourt.  \u201cAmong other things, Reed argued that the law\u2019s stringent chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional and in effect foreclosed DNA \ntesting for individuals convicted before \u2018rules governing the State\u2019s handling \nand storage of evidence were put in place.\u2019\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 233 (quoting \nJoint Appendix at 39, Reed, 598 U.S. 230 (No. 21-442)).3  \nIf Reed is to be distinguished from the case, we need to determine if \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations \nviolated federal law, that Reed\u2019s claim would still fail.  That court certainly \ngave lengthy consideration to Reed\u2019s effort to acquire DNA testing of certain \nevidence.  See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 764\u201380 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).  \nThe court held that numerous items were not available for DNA testing \nbecause the chain of custody for them was broken.  Id. at 770.  The court did \nnot discuss the constitutionality of the state\u2019s chain-of-custody requirements \nor whether Reed would gain the testing if they violated a federal right.4    \n_____________________ \n3 It gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining \nthe state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.  That \ncould mean, implicitly, that the state court opinion was irrelevant.  Instead, perhaps this \nprinciple applies: \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the \nattention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. \n507, 511 (1925)).  We examined the Reed briefs at the Supreme Court; none argued that \nsome holding in the state court opinion would affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.   \nWe adopt the \u201clurk in the record\u201d option and consider the distinction viable.  As \nwe discuss, one good reason for silence in the briefs and in the Supreme Court opinion is \nthat the Court of Criminal Appeals made no similar pronouncement in its Reed decision. \n4 The initial briefs submitted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Reed did \nnot allege unconstitutionality in the chain-of-custody requirements.  Understandably, then, \nthe state court\u2019s opinion did not discuss, as the Gutierrez opinion did, whether DNA testing \nwould be justified even if the relevant requirements were unconstitutional.  Reed first \nraised a constitutional argument about chain of custody in his motion for rehearing.  The \nstate court denied rehearing without an opinion.  See Order Denying Rehearing, Reed, 541 \nS.W.3d 759 (No. AP\u201377,054), available at https://search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?cn=AP-\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA13\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n13 \nConsidering this background, what is the federal issue that could be \nresolved in this Section 1983 suit that would have a likely effect on the \nprosecutor?  The Court of Criminal Appeals has already found that Gutierrez \nwould have no right to DNA testing even if the statutory bar to testing for \nevidence about sentencing were held to be unconstitutional.  The federal \ndistrict court found unconstitutionality, but according to the Court of \nCriminal Appeals, any new evidence \u201cwould not overcome the \noverwhelming evidence of his direct involvement in the multi-assailant \nmurder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  Gutierrez acknowledges he is not \nentitled to DNA testing for what amounts to mitigation evidence, i.e., \nevidence that might cause a reasonable juror to decide not to vote for the \ndeath penalty because, for example, he did not himself commit the murder.   \nThe following summarizes Gutierrez\u2019s argument as to what DNA \nevidence could prove: \nDNA evidence that identifies perpetrators but excludes Mr. \nGutierrez would establish that Mr. Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not \nparticipate in the murder.  This evidence thus would cast doubt \non whether Mr. Gutierrez \u201cactually caused the death of the \ndecedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that \na human life would be taken.\u201d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. \n37.071(b)(2).  \n \nGutierrez\u2019s disagreement with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 finding \nthat DNA evidence would not override the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of \nguilt of a capital crime is a factual disagreement about the potential effect of \nnew evidence on jurors.  This declaratory judgment action is a facial \n_____________________ \n77,054&coa=coscca.  Thus, the Texas court made no holding in Reed comparable to its \nholding in Gutierrez about potential invalidation of the challenged requirement. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA14\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n14 \nchallenge to Texas statutes.  It is not properly used to contest fact-findings \nby a state court in that court\u2019s prior denial of DNA testing.   \nReed is properly distinguished.  As to Gutierrez, the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals effectively anticipated an unfavorable federal court ruling.  \nThat court held, should the limitation on DNA testing for evidence relevant \nonly to conviction be invalid, the facts in the trial record would prevent \nGutierrez from receiving the DNA testing because such evidence could not \nchange the fact that he was death-eligible.  As a result, we conclude that a \nstate court, if presented with Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing, would be \nbound by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 holding that such testing \nwould be meaningless.  The Reed analysis that standing requires that a \nprosecutor be likely to grant access to the requested evidence should a \nfavorable federal court ruling be obtained cannot be satisfied on the facts of \nthis case. \nBecause there is not a substantial likelihood that a favorable ruling by \na federal court on Gutierrez\u2019s claims would cause the prosecutor to order \nDNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s claims are not redressable in this Section 1983 suit.  \nWe VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND to have the \ncomplaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA15\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n15 \nStephen A. Higginson, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nWith respect, I disagree that Ruben Gutierrez, a defendant facing ex-\necution, lacks standing to bring this suit.  \nI do not see a meaningful distinction from Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 \n(2023), where the Supreme Court held \u201ca prisoner had standing to pursue a \ndeclaratory judgment against a state prosecutor that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA testing law \u2018failed to provide procedural due process,\u2019\u201d Majority Op. \nat 7 (quoting in part Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). In the same context we face here, \nrelating to a capital defendant\u2019s challenge to Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, the Supreme Court clarified that if a federal court decides \nthat procedure violates due process, the decision \u201cwould have ordered a \nchange in a legal status [that] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evi-\ndence and that [the prisoner] therefore would obtain relief that directly re-\ndresses the injury suffered.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nLike Reed, Gutierrez filed suit against the appropriate local prosecu-\ntor and made a similar claim regarding Texas\u2019s DNA testing regime.  While \nI appreciate the majority\u2019s careful tracing of the state-court case history and \nfair inquiry into what the named state prosecutor might or might not do, I do \nnot perceive that the Supreme Court contemplated this nuance and distinc-\ntion.  Instead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what Dis-\ntrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a declar-\natory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure would signifi-\ncantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to \nthe requested DNA testing.  \nBecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also fac-\ning execution, has standing to bring suit.   \n \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA16\n\nState v.

(Trial Order)\nDistrict Court of Texas,\n107th Judicial District.\nCameron County\nState of Texas,\nv.\nRuben GUTIERREZ.\nNo. 98-CR-1391-A.\nJuly 27, 2010.\nOrder on Defendants Motion for Forensic DNA Testing\nHon. Benjamin Euresti, Jr., Judge Presiding.\nON THIS DAY CAME TO BE CONSIDERED DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR DNA TESTING, and the Court, in reviewing\nthe applicable statutes governing the instant Motion, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01, et seq., Defendant's Motion, the State's\nResponse, and the court's entire record, finds that Defendant's prayer for relief cannot be favored, for the following reasons:\n1. Defendant's Motion fails to comply with Texas Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B). Defendant did have\nthe opportunity to inspect all physical evidence in the State's possession before trial began including those\nspecific items listed in his motion. There has been no complaint raised regarding ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel for any alleged failure to have an independent expert appointed, to have testing performed on\nany evidence, or to request a continuance prior to trial so these matters could be done. Trial counsel advised\nthis Court, prior to trial, that after reviewing the evidence it would make any such requests if it deemed\nnecessary. No such requests were made and no objections were lodged. Thus, fault is attributable to the\n\u201cconvicted person\u201d as to why the biological material was not previously subjected to DNA testing. This\nCourt finds that Defendant has failed to make a \u201cparticularized\u201d showing that the biological materials were\nnever tested through no fault of his own. Routier v. State, 273 S.W.3d 241,247 (Tex.Crim.App.2008).\n2. In reviewing State's response pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.02, the Court finds that DNA\nevidence, specifically the single loose hair described in Defendant's motion, does not exist because it was\nnever recovered as evidence in the investigation of the case and there is no record of a chain of custody\nfor the single loose hair. The Court finds that the non-existence of this piece of evidence was not caused\nby any bad faith of the State.\n3. Further, even if fault was not attributable to the Defendant concerning the remaining untested biological\nevidence listed in his motion, the Court finds the following:\na. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(1)(B), specifically\nthat identity was not and is not an issue in the case considering the entire record, to include the Defendant's statements, the Co-\ndefendants' statements to investigators, the testimony of an eyewitness connecting the Defendant to the murder scene.\nb. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(2)(A), specifically\nthe Defendant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been convicted if \u201cexculpatory\nresults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d\nA43\n\nState v.

Southwick, Circuit Judge: \nIn 1999, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sen-\ntenced to death in a Texas state court.  Since 2011, Gutierrez\u2019s efforts to se-\ncure postconviction DNA testing have been denied in state and federal court.  \nIn this Section 1983 case, the district court accepted his claim that a particular \nlimitation in Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute was unconstitutional.  We con-\nclude that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim.  We VACATE the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the complaint to be dismissed \nfor lack of jurisdiction.     \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFifth Circuit \nFILED \nFebruary 8, 2024 \n \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA2\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n2 \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \nIn September 1998, 85-year-old Escolastica Harrison was murdered.  \nEx parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).  Harrison \nhad been living with her nephew, Avel Cuellar, in a home that also served as \nthe office for a mobile-home park in Brownsville, Texas. Gutierrez and Cuel-\nlar were friends.  They along with other friends frequently gathered behind \nHarrison\u2019s home to drink and socialize.  Because of Harrison\u2019s mistrust of \nbanks, she had about $600,000 in cash in her home.  Gutierrez had be-\nfriended Harrison and sometimes ran errands for her.  Sadly, that led to \nGutierrez\u2019s finding out about the money.  Gutierrez crafted a plan to steal it.   \n \nThree men were involved in the crime on September 5, 1998:  \nGutierrez, Rene Garcia, and Pedro Gracia.  Only two entered the home, and \nGutierrez insists he was the one who stayed outside.  Harrison was murdered \nduring the robbery.  Police soon considered Gutierrez a suspect.   \n \nOn three separate days, Gutierrez made three contradictory state-\nments to the police.  Gutierrez first told police he was not involved with Har-\nrison\u2019s murder, claiming an alibi.  When the alibi failed, Gutierrez told police \nthat he had planned to \u201crip off\u201d Harrison but had waited at a park while Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia stole from her; he had never wanted them to kill her.  \nGutierrez last stated that he had lied about waiting in a park and that he had, \nin fact, been in Harrison\u2019s home on the day of her murder.  When Rene Gar-\ncia failed to lure Harrison outside the home so that Gutierrez could discretely \nsteal the money, Gutierrez entered and saw Rene Garcia repeatedly stab the \nvictim with a screwdriver.  Gutierrez took the money, and Pedro Gracia \ndrove the three of them away from the home.   \n \nAt the 1999 trial in Cameron County state district court, the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s theory was that Gutierrez intentionally murdered Harrison, either as a \nprincipal or party.  The prosecution relied on (1) the testimony of the medical \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA3\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n3 \nexaminer that the stab wounds came from two different screwdrivers; (2) \nGutierrez\u2019s statement that he and Rene Garcia had been inside the victim\u2019s \nhome with two different screwdrivers; and (3) four witnesses placing \nGutierrez at the crime scene on the day of the killing.  \nThe jury was instructed that it could convict Gutierrez for capital \nmurder if it found he acted alone or as a party with an accomplice to cause \nHarrison\u2019s death intentionally.  The jury returned a general verdict of guilt, \nand in April 1999 the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Texas Court \nof Criminal Appeals affirmed in 2002.   \nThen began decades-long postconviction proceedings.  Gutierrez filed \na state habeas application that was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals in 2008.  Gutierrez then filed a habeas application in federal district \ncourt in 2009.  The district court stayed the proceedings to allow him to pur-\nsue unexhausted state law claims in state court.  As part of these additional \nclaims, Gutierrez requested counsel be appointed to file a Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure Chapter 64 motion for DNA testing of several pieces of \nevidence:  (1) a blood sample taken from the victim; (2) a shirt belonging to \nCuellar that had blood stains on it; (3) nail scrapings from the victim; (4) sev-\neral blood samples from in the home; and (5) a loose hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s finger.  The state court denied the request, and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal from the decision as premature be-\ncause he had not actually filed a motion for DNA testing at that point.   \nGutierrez then filed his state-court motion for postconviction DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 in 2010.  In his motion, Gutierrez acknowledged \nbeing one of the three men involved in the robbery of Harrison.  He claimed \nDNA evidence would show he was not one of the two individuals who en-\ntered the victim\u2019s home \u2014 and by extension, would show by a preponderance \nof the evidence that jurors would not have convicted him of capital murder \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA4\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n4 \nor sentenced him to death.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The Court of \nCriminal Appeals affirmed in 2011, in part on the grounds that Chapter 64 \n\u201cdoes not authorize testing when exculpatory testing results might affect \nonly the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d  Id. at 901 (citing TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 64.03(a)(2)(A)). \nThe federal district court reopened the habeas case once the state \nproceedings concluded in 2011.  It denied Gutierrez\u2019s habeas application \nentirely and his request for a certificate of appealability.  See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2014).  This court also denied a \ncertificate of appealability.  Id. at 375.    \nOver the next few years, Gutierrez continued to seek DNA testing.  In \nJune 2019, the state district court initially granted his motion for DNA testing \nbut withdrew the order a few days later and then denied the motion.  On \nFebruary 26, 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the denial.  \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. Crim. App. \nFeb. 26, 2020). \nWhile the state-court proceedings were ongoing, Gutierrez brought \nthis suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court, \nSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville.  The only defendants who are \nparties to this appeal are Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz \nand Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda, Jr.  Gutierrez\u2019s September 2019 \ncomplaint challenged both (1) the constitutionality of Texas postconviction \nDNA testing procedures, and (2) execution protocols prohibiting the \npresence of chaplains or religious ministers inside the execution room.  \nGutierrez amended his complaint after the February 2020 decision of the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals.  The defendants moved to dismiss.  The district \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part but declined to dismiss \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA5\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n5 \nGutierrez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Texas law on DNA testing.  \nGutierrez\u2019s execution was then stayed.   \nThis court vacated the district court\u2019s stay, but our decision was in \nturn vacated by the Supreme Court.  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 818 F. App\u2019x 309, \n315 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 141 S. Ct. 1260 (2021).  \nThe Supreme Court ordered us \u201cto remand the case to the District Court for \nfurther and prompt consideration of the merits of petitioner\u2019s underlying \nclaims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution \nchamber.\u201d  Gutierrez, 141 S. Ct. at 1261.  That is what we did.    \nIn March 2023, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 opposed \nmotion to dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s religious exercise claims as moot after the \nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice submitted an affidavit \napproving Gutierrez\u2019s request to have his chosen spiritual adviser pray aloud \nand place a hand on Gutierrez\u2019s shoulder during the execution, among other \nrequests.  Gutierrez did not appeal the dismissal.  \nBesides the religious accommodation issues, Gutierrez continued his \nefforts to acquire DNA testing.  He claimed that a limitation under Texas law \nfor acquiring that testing was unconstitutional.  The alleged invalidity was \nnot directly with Chapter 64 but with how it improperly limited the rights \ngranted in another Texas statute that governs successive habeas applications \nfor those sentenced to death.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.071.  As the \nfederal district court put it, \u201cTexas grants the substantive right to file a \nsecond habeas petition with a clear and convincing showing of innocence of \nthe death penalty in Article 11.071 [\u00a7 5(a)(3)], and then Chapter 64 denies \nthe petitioner access to DNA evidence by which a person can avail himself of \nthat right.\u201d  Gutierrez v. Saenz, 565 F. Supp. 3d 892, 910 (S.D. Tex. 2021).  \nIn the district court\u2019s view, the right to bring a successive habeas application \nto claim innocence of the death penalty was \u201cillusory\u201d and therefore violated \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA6\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n6 \nprocedural due process.  Id. at 910\u201311.  The district court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment for Gutierrez.  Id. at 911.  The district court later \nentered partial final judgment as to the DNA claims.  The defendants timely \nappealed.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nBecause we conclude that Gutierrez did not have standing to bring this \nsuit, it is the only issue we consider.1   \n \nTexas prisoner Gutierrez brought suit under Section 1983 to challenge \nthe constitutionality of a limitation under Texas law for when death-row \ninmates are entitled to DNA testing of evidence.   Section 1983 is the \nnecessary federal statutory vehicle because, as we will later discuss at some \nlength, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier denied Gutierrez the \ntesting he seeks.  Though barred from making a direct challenge in federal \ncourt to that state-court denial, he may make a facial challenge to the statutes, \nrules, and interpretations on which the denial was based.  See Truong v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., 717 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 2013).  The Supreme Court recently \napplied those principles when it allowed another Texas inmate\u2019s claim of \nconstitutional defect in Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedures after the Court of \nCriminal Appeals had denied such testing.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, \n_____________________ \n1 The district court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional challenge is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.  Section 1983 claims \nare subject to a state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations.  Wallace v. Kato, 549 \nU.S. 384, 387 (2007).  The parties agree that the relevant statute is Texas\u2019s general \npersonal injury statute of limitations, which is two years.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \n\u00a7 16.003(a).  The district court concluded that events long after the 2011 Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals opinion that first upheld the denial of DNA testing to Gutierrez had \nrestarted the two-year period.  Those events, though, such as amendments to the DNA \nstatute, would have to be germane to the claim that prohibiting testing for evidence that at \nmost would affect sentencing violated due process.  Otherwise, the claim was untimely.  In \nlight of our ruling as to standing, we need not resolve this separate issue. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA7\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n7 \n235 (2023).  Even though the Court of Criminal Appeals had already rejected \nthat prisoner\u2019s effort to have DNA testing of evidence, the Supreme Court \nallowed the claim because he did \u201c\u2018not challenge the adverse\u2019 state-court \ndecisions themselves, but rather \u2018target[ed] as unconstitutional the Texas \nstatute they authoritatively construed.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 \nU.S. 521, 532 (2011)). \nReed\u2019s argument was that strict chain-of-custody requirements \nviolated due process.  Id. at 233.  Gutierrez has a different claim, namely, that \nthe state violates due process by permitting testing only if the evidence could \nestablish the prisoner would not have been convicted, thereby preventing \ntesting if resulting evidence would be relevant only to the sentence.  The \ndefendants allege that Gutierrez has no standing to make that claim.  If a party \nlacks Article III standing to pursue claims, a federal court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to adjudicate them.  See Abraugh v. Altimus, 26 F.4th 298, 304 \n(5th Cir. 2022).  We examine standing de novo.  NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir. 2010). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) an \n\u201cinjury in fact\u201d has occurred; (2) the injury can fairly be traced to the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) a favorable ruling will likely redress the injury.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992).  The defendant district \nattorney and police chief assert that Gutierrez cannot satisfy the third \nrequirement.  Gutierrez\u2019s claimed injury is not redressable against these \ndefendants, the argument goes, because they do not enforce Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting statute and the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment does not direct \nthem to do anything.  Our question, then, is whether a declaratory judgment \nthat Texas\u2019s procedures for DNA testing are constitutionally flawed \nredresses the claimed injury. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA8\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n8 \nSeeking an answer, we return to the recent Supreme Court precedent \nthat allowed a different inmate to assert a claim about flaws in Texas\u2019s DNA \ntesting requirements.  See Reed, 598 U.S. 230.  The Court concluded that a \nprisoner had standing to pursue a declaratory judgment against a state \nprosecutor that Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing law \u201cfailed to provide \nprocedural due process.\u201d  Id. at 233\u201334; see Reed v. Goertz, 995 F.3d 425, 428 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (stating that Reed sought a declaratory judgment), rev\u2019d 598 \nU.S. at 237.  A favorable declaratory judgment would likely redress the injury, \nthe Court found, because it \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.   \nIn other words, in \u201cterms of our \u2018standing\u2019 precedent, the \ncourts would have ordered a change in a legal status,\u201d and \u201cthe \npractical consequence of that change would amount to a \nsignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested evidence and that [the \nprisoner] therefore \u201cwould obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u201d \nId. (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)). \nThat analysis initially seems equally applicable here.  Gutierrez has \nbrought his claim against the correct party \u2014 the local prosecutor \u2014 and, \nlike Reed, challenges a Texas DNA testing requirement.  Texas argues there \nis a distinction, though.  This prosecutor would not likely reverse course and \nallow testing, the argument posits, even were a federal court to declare Texas \nmay not deny DNA testing that would affect only the punishment stage.  \nAllegedly keeping the prosecutor on course is the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals\u2019 prior holding that such a decision would not entitle Gutierrez to \ntesting.  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  We now examine that part of the state \ncourt\u2019s opinion. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA9\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n9 \nGutierrez\u2019s relevant argument both in 2011 and now starts with the \nfact that Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nallows a death-row inmate\u2019s claim that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor \none or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the \napplicant\u2019s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.\u201d  Section 5(a)(2) \nprovides that, \u201cbut for a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\u201d  Because the statute allows an inmate to contest his conviction and \nalso his sentence, Gutierrez argues it is unconstitutional for Chapter 64 to \npermit DNA testing only for claims about the conviction.    \nThe Court of Criminal Appeals, though, held in 2011 that \u201ceven if \nChapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction,\u201d Gutierrez would not be entitled to the testing because he \n\u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901.  The \ncourt held that his eligibility existed because the evidence was sufficient to \nshow his knowing participation in the robbery and a mental state at least of \nreckless indifference to the possibility of murder.  Id. at 901 & n.61.   \nGutierrez agrees that the appeal turns on whether DNA evidence \nmight show he was not \u201cdeath-eligible\u201d but argues DNA testing could show \njust that by proving he did not commit the murder itself and neither intended \nnor anticipated anyone would be killed.  That collection of requirements \ncomes from Article 37.071 \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, \na provision that identifies the jury issues when guilt would arise if jurors find \nthat the defendant was a party to a crime.   \nInstead of \u201cnot death-eligible,\u201d the district court and some of our \ncited authorities have used the awkward phrase \u201cinnocent of the death \npenalty.\u201d  See Gutierrez, 565 F. Supp. 3d at 901.  That wording has been used \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA10\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n10 \nwhen discussing the test for whether a prisoner with a capital sentence may \nbring a successive habeas application in federal court.  The inmate must \nshow, \u201cbased on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair \nprobability that a rational trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable \ndoubt as to the existence of those facts which are prerequisites under state or \nfederal law for the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d  Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 \nU.S. 333, 346 (1992) (quoting Sawyer v. Whitley, 945 F.2d 812, 820 (5th Cir. \n1991)).  Gutierrez agrees that the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of \u201cdeath-\neligible\u201d is the equivalent.  In Sawyer, the Supreme Court wrote \u201cthat the \n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 requirement must focus on those elements that render a \ndefendant eligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating \nevidence.\u201d  Id. at 347.   \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if DNA evidence \ndemonstrated Gutierrez was not in the house when Harrison was murdered, \nthat proof \u201cwould not overcome the overwhelming evidence of his direct \ninvolvement in the multi-assailant murder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  \nWhatever DNA evidence might prove, other evidence sufficiently supported \nthat Gutierrez was still legally subject to the death penalty: \nAppellant would still have been death-eligible because the \nrecord facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements \nthat he played a major role in the underlying robbery and that \nhis acts showed a reckless indifference to human life.[2] \n_____________________ \n2 The court\u2019s footnote 61 to the statement was this:  \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) \n(Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty as disproportionate \nin case of defendant whose participation in felony that results in murder is \nmajor and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); Article \n37.071(2)(b)(2).  \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA11\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n11 \nId.  In 2020, the Court of Criminal Appeals restated that reasoning when \nagain denying relief.  Gutierrez, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nThe State\u2019s argument here is that Reed does not apply when a Section \n1983 plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that some state statute or rule \nviolates federal law, but the highest state court already considered that \npossible violation and found it would not justify the relief being sought.  We \nconclude that if the reasons the state court found there would be no effect do \nnot raise another issue of federal law, there is merit to the distinction between \nReed and this case.   \nThe Reed question here is would a Texas prosecutor, having in hand a \nfederal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing requirement violated federal law \nand also an earlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this particular \nprisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the DNA \ntesting?  In applying the concept of likely effect, the Supreme Court in Reed \nquoted an opinion analyzing standing for a challenge to the \u201ccounting \nmethod\u201d used by the Census Bureau and Secretary of Commerce when \nallocating congressional seats after the 2000 census.  Evans, 536 U.S. at 460\u2013\n61.  The Court stated that the President and Secretary were likely to abide by \nan authoritative pronouncement from the Court that the counting method \nviolated either a statute or the Constitution.  Id. at 463\u201364.  We interpret that \nholding as the result of the Court\u2019s fact-specific evaluation, not just a \ncategorical statement that whenever the Supreme Court speaks, government \nofficials will respond mechanically.  The specifics of the case are important \nin deciding how the decision is likely to affect a relevant actor.  We conclude \nthat a state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s highest \ncriminal court has already held should be the effect of such a decision. \nThe final step before adopting the proposed distinction is to see if it \nactually distinguishes Reed.  We start with what Reed argued at the Supreme \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA12\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n12 \nCourt.  \u201cAmong other things, Reed argued that the law\u2019s stringent chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional and in effect foreclosed DNA \ntesting for individuals convicted before \u2018rules governing the State\u2019s handling \nand storage of evidence were put in place.\u2019\u201d  Reed, 598 U.S. at 233 (quoting \nJoint Appendix at 39, Reed, 598 U.S. 230 (No. 21-442)).3  \nIf Reed is to be distinguished from the case, we need to determine if \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations \nviolated federal law, that Reed\u2019s claim would still fail.  That court certainly \ngave lengthy consideration to Reed\u2019s effort to acquire DNA testing of certain \nevidence.  See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 764\u201380 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).  \nThe court held that numerous items were not available for DNA testing \nbecause the chain of custody for them was broken.  Id. at 770.  The court did \nnot discuss the constitutionality of the state\u2019s chain-of-custody requirements \nor whether Reed would gain the testing if they violated a federal right.4    \n_____________________ \n3 It gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining \nthe state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.  That \ncould mean, implicitly, that the state court opinion was irrelevant.  Instead, perhaps this \nprinciple applies: \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the \nattention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. \n507, 511 (1925)).  We examined the Reed briefs at the Supreme Court; none argued that \nsome holding in the state court opinion would affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions.   \nWe adopt the \u201clurk in the record\u201d option and consider the distinction viable.  As \nwe discuss, one good reason for silence in the briefs and in the Supreme Court opinion is \nthat the Court of Criminal Appeals made no similar pronouncement in its Reed decision. \n4 The initial briefs submitted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Reed did \nnot allege unconstitutionality in the chain-of-custody requirements.  Understandably, then, \nthe state court\u2019s opinion did not discuss, as the Gutierrez opinion did, whether DNA testing \nwould be justified even if the relevant requirements were unconstitutional.  Reed first \nraised a constitutional argument about chain of custody in his motion for rehearing.  The \nstate court denied rehearing without an opinion.  See Order Denying Rehearing, Reed, 541 \nS.W.3d 759 (No. AP\u201377,054), available at https://search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?cn=AP-\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA13\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n13 \nConsidering this background, what is the federal issue that could be \nresolved in this Section 1983 suit that would have a likely effect on the \nprosecutor?  The Court of Criminal Appeals has already found that Gutierrez \nwould have no right to DNA testing even if the statutory bar to testing for \nevidence about sentencing were held to be unconstitutional.  The federal \ndistrict court found unconstitutionality, but according to the Court of \nCriminal Appeals, any new evidence \u201cwould not overcome the \noverwhelming evidence of his direct involvement in the multi-assailant \nmurder.\u201d  Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 902.  Gutierrez acknowledges he is not \nentitled to DNA testing for what amounts to mitigation evidence, i.e., \nevidence that might cause a reasonable juror to decide not to vote for the \ndeath penalty because, for example, he did not himself commit the murder.   \nThe following summarizes Gutierrez\u2019s argument as to what DNA \nevidence could prove: \nDNA evidence that identifies perpetrators but excludes Mr. \nGutierrez would establish that Mr. Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not \nparticipate in the murder.  This evidence thus would cast doubt \non whether Mr. Gutierrez \u201cactually caused the death of the \ndecedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that \na human life would be taken.\u201d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. \n37.071(b)(2).  \n \nGutierrez\u2019s disagreement with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 finding \nthat DNA evidence would not override the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of \nguilt of a capital crime is a factual disagreement about the potential effect of \nnew evidence on jurors.  This declaratory judgment action is a facial \n_____________________ \n77,054&coa=coscca.  Thus, the Texas court made no holding in Reed comparable to its \nholding in Gutierrez about potential invalidation of the challenged requirement. \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA14\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n14 \nchallenge to Texas statutes.  It is not properly used to contest fact-findings \nby a state court in that court\u2019s prior denial of DNA testing.   \nReed is properly distinguished.  As to Gutierrez, the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals effectively anticipated an unfavorable federal court ruling.  \nThat court held, should the limitation on DNA testing for evidence relevant \nonly to conviction be invalid, the facts in the trial record would prevent \nGutierrez from receiving the DNA testing because such evidence could not \nchange the fact that he was death-eligible.  As a result, we conclude that a \nstate court, if presented with Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing, would be \nbound by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 holding that such testing \nwould be meaningless.  The Reed analysis that standing requires that a \nprosecutor be likely to grant access to the requested evidence should a \nfavorable federal court ruling be obtained cannot be satisfied on the facts of \nthis case. \nBecause there is not a substantial likelihood that a favorable ruling by \na federal court on Gutierrez\u2019s claims would cause the prosecutor to order \nDNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s claims are not redressable in this Section 1983 suit.  \nWe VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND to have the \ncomplaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA15\n\nNo. 21-70009 \n15 \nStephen A. Higginson, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nWith respect, I disagree that Ruben Gutierrez, a defendant facing ex-\necution, lacks standing to bring this suit.  \nI do not see a meaningful distinction from Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 \n(2023), where the Supreme Court held \u201ca prisoner had standing to pursue a \ndeclaratory judgment against a state prosecutor that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA testing law \u2018failed to provide procedural due process,\u2019\u201d Majority Op. \nat 7 (quoting in part Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). In the same context we face here, \nrelating to a capital defendant\u2019s challenge to Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, the Supreme Court clarified that if a federal court decides \nthat procedure violates due process, the decision \u201cwould have ordered a \nchange in a legal status [that] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evi-\ndence and that [the prisoner] therefore would obtain relief that directly re-\ndresses the injury suffered.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nLike Reed, Gutierrez filed suit against the appropriate local prosecu-\ntor and made a similar claim regarding Texas\u2019s DNA testing regime.  While \nI appreciate the majority\u2019s careful tracing of the state-court case history and \nfair inquiry into what the named state prosecutor might or might not do, I do \nnot perceive that the Supreme Court contemplated this nuance and distinc-\ntion.  Instead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what Dis-\ntrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a declar-\natory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure would signifi-\ncantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to \nthe requested DNA testing.  \nBecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also fac-\ning execution, has standing to bring suit.   \n \nCase: 21-70009      Document: 126-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/08/2024\nA16\n\nState v.

Benjamin Euresti, Jr., Judge Presiding.\nON THIS DAY CAME TO BE CONSIDERED DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR DNA TESTING, and the Court, in reviewing\nthe applicable statutes governing the instant Motion, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01, et seq., Defendant's Motion, the State's\nResponse, and the court's entire record, finds that Defendant's prayer for relief cannot be favored, for the following reasons:\n1. Defendant's Motion fails to comply with Texas Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B). Defendant did have\nthe opportunity to inspect all physical evidence in the State's possession before trial began including those\nspecific items listed in his motion. There has been no complaint raised regarding ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel for any alleged failure to have an independent expert appointed, to have testing performed on\nany evidence, or to request a continuance prior to trial so these matters could be done. Trial counsel advised\nthis Court, prior to trial, that after reviewing the evidence it would make any such requests if it deemed\nnecessary. No such requests were made and no objections were lodged. Thus, fault is attributable to the\n\u201cconvicted person\u201d as to why the biological material was not previously subjected to DNA testing. This\nCourt finds that Defendant has failed to make a \u201cparticularized\u201d showing that the biological materials were\nnever tested through no fault of his own. Routier v. State, 273 S.W.3d 241,247 (Tex.Crim.App.2008).\n2. In reviewing State's response pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.02, the Court finds that DNA\nevidence, specifically the single loose hair described in Defendant's motion, does not exist because it was\nnever recovered as evidence in the investigation of the case and there is no record of a chain of custody\nfor the single loose hair. The Court finds that the non-existence of this piece of evidence was not caused\nby any bad faith of the State.\n3. Further, even if fault was not attributable to the Defendant concerning the remaining untested biological\nevidence listed in his motion, the Court finds the following:\na. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(1)(B), specifically\nthat identity was not and is not an issue in the case considering the entire record, to include the Defendant's statements, the Co-\ndefendants' statements to investigators, the testimony of an eyewitness connecting the Defendant to the murder scene.\nb. The Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 64.03(a)(2)(A), specifically\nthe Defendant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been convicted if \u201cexculpatory\nresults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d\nA43\n\nState v.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed. See Johnson v. \nGriffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). \nThe question presented is: \n \nDoes Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a \nspecific state official will redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by following a favorable \ndeclaratory judgment? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS IN LOWER FEDERAL COURTS \n \nSouthern District of Texas, Gutierrez v.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024 WL 2964140 (U.S. June 13, 2024), and \nReed, 598 U.S. 230.  \nI. \nTHE DECISION BELOW CREATES A CIRCUIT SPLIT BY \nREOPENING A QUESTON THAT THIS COURT SOUGHT TO \nSETTLE IN REED. \nCertiorari review is crucial when courts of appeals disagree about an area of \nfederal law. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a); see also Reed, 598 U.S.at 234 (certiorari granted to \nresolve circuit split regarding \u201cwhen the statute of limitations begins to run for a \n\u00a7 1983 suit regarding a State\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures\u201d). The need to \nresolve the circuit split in this case is particularly important because this Court had \nalready settled the precise standing issue before the Fifth Circuit, yet the Fifth \nCircuit opinion conflicts with that holding and creates an awkward new rule for \nstanding, requiring a pre-jurisdictional mini-trial to forecast the conduct of state \nofficials in response to a not-yet-issued declaratory judgment. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).  \nThe Fifth Circuit panel majority\u2019s rewriting of this Court\u2019s clearly established \nlaw should be addressed before additional circuit courts of appeals are faced with \ncases brought by plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions seeking declaratory judgments, and cases \nlooking to apply Reed\u2019s standing analysis generally.  \n\n \n12 \n \nA. \nThe Eighth Circuit \nThe majority\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 \n(8th Cir. 2023). Johnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in \nthe context of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional because it violates due process. Johnson, like Reed and Gutierrez, is \non death row, and sued the prosecuting attorney in his Arkansas county pursuant to \na \u00a7 1983 action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the State\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting statute violated due process. \nThe Eighth Circuit held that Johnson had standing under circumstances that \nare all but identical to those here. After recognizing the defendant\u2019s argument that \nstanding was not specifically addressed in either Osborne or Skinner, the Eighth \nCircuit stated: \u201c[A]ny lingering doubt about a prisoner\u2019s standing to bring the distinct \nprocedural due process claim recognized by those two cases was dispelled by the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Reed v. Goertz.\u201d Johnson, 69 F.4th at 511. The \nEighth Circuit held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s injury is redressable because, as explained in \nReed, \u2018if a federal court concludes [Arkansas\u2019s] post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate\u2019 the Prosecuting \nAttorney\u2019s \u2018justification for denying DNA testing.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority\u2019s reasoning, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nfinding of standing was unaffected by the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s prior holding in \nJohnson\u2019s motion for DNA testing that Arkansas\u2019s statute allows DNA testing only if \nit will \u201csignificantly advance\u201d the prisoner\u2019s claim of innocence, and that \u201cnone of the \nevidence that might result from the proposed testing could advance Johnson\u2019s claim \n\n \n13 \n \nof actual innocence.\u201d Id. at 508 (quoting state court decision). The Eighth Circuit, like \nJudge Higginson, simply followed Reed and applied it to the legal posture of the case. \nB. \nThe Ninth Circuit \nThe ruling below also contravenes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of Reed. In \nRedd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), Redd filed a \u00a7 1983 action against \njudges in the state court system, alleging that California\u2019s system of appointing \ncounsel violated his due process rights. \u201c[T]he State Officers contended that Redd \nlacks standing because his injury is not redressable by a decision in its favor.\u201d Id. at \n884. The Ninth Circuit concluded: \u201cOnce a court issues a declaratory judgment, that \norder effectuates a change in the legal status between the parties such that \u2018the \npractical consequences of that change would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the plaintiff \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Reed, 598 U.S. at 234 (additional internal quotations omitted)).  \nThe Ninth Circuit did not stop there:   \nIn Reed, for example, a Texas prisoner filed a section 1983 action \nclaiming the state\u2019s postconviction DNA procedures violated procedural \ndue process. . . . The \u201conly relief\u201d sought was \u201ca declaration that the \n[state court\u2019s] interpretation and application of state law was \nunconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment \nagainst the state prosecutor would redress that state\u2019s denial of DNA \ntesting. The declaration sought \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing\u201d and make it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d \nthat the state prosecutor would abide by the court\u2019s decision. \n \nId. (quoting Reed, 598 at 234) (additional internal quotations omitted). The Ninth \nCircuit thus did not undertake an individualized standing analysis to predict whether \nthe state defendants would actually give Redd the relief he sought if he prevailed in \nfederal court. The court instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was \n\n \n14 \n \nsimilarly situated to Reed\u2014exactly as the Eighth Circuit did in Johnson and as Judge \nHigginson did in his dissent here. \nII. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION CONTRADICTS THIS COURT\u2019S \nDECISION IN REED. \nBoth Ruben Gutierrez and Rodney Reed sit on death row in Texas. Both men \npetitioned their respective Texas district courts for post-conviction DNA testing \npursuant to Chapter 64, and both men were denied testing. Both men appealed to the \nCCA, and the CCA affirmed in both cases. The CCA told both men that, even if they \ngot the DNA testing they wanted, they would still ultimately be unable to obtain the \nrelief they sought. See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); \nA79. \nBoth men filed \u00a7 1983 lawsuits in federal district court seeking declaratory \njudgments that Texas\u2019s Chapter 64 violates their due process rights. Reed argued \nthat Chapter 64 violates his due process rights because the chain-of-custody \nrequirements were too demanding. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 violates his due \nprocess rights because he could not move for testing to show he was innocent of the \ndeath penalty, despite a clear right to file a subsequent habeas petition on that \nground under Texas Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3). Both men named the local District \nAttorneys as defendants. Both District Attorneys opposed DNA testing and continue \nto oppose DNA testing.  \nBoth men were found by the district courts to have Article III standing. \nGutierrez prevailed in district court and obtained a declaratory judgment in his favor. \nA42. The district court in Reed\u2019s case dismissed his \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\n \n15 \n \nfor failing to establish Chapter 64 violated due process. Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-\n0794-LY, 2019 WL 12073901, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). The losing parties in \nboth cases appealed to the Fifth Circuit.  \nHere, the men\u2019s paths diverged. The Fifth Circuit did not question that Reed \nhad standing to bring his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit but found the action untimely. Reed v. \nGoertz, 995 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2021). On certiorari review, this Court rejected Texas\u2019s \nargument that Reed lacked standing and instead ruled that a favorable federal \njudgment \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting\u201d and create a substantial likelihood of compliance by the State. Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234. This Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s timeliness ruling and remanded \nfor further proceedings. Id. at 237.  \nIn Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit grafted onto \nReed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the opposite result. The \nmajority scoured the state court record, including briefing by the parties, and \nspeculated that, in this case, state officials would not permit DNA testing even in the \nface of a federal court judgment because, in earlier proceedings, the CCA commented \nthat favorable DNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the \nredressability prong of Article III standing.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well beyond the analysis this Court \nestablished in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not \nmention examining the state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the \n\n \n16 \n \nprosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3. The majority justified its departure from \nReed based on the principle that \u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having \nbeen so decided.\u201d Id. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). The majority opined, in \nother words, that this Court did not parse the state court record in Reed because that \nrecord simply escaped this Court\u2019s attention.  \n\u201cThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly rooted in American \nconstitutional law.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at *6. To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered an injury in fact, (ii) the injury \nlikely was caused by the defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be redressed by \nthe requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 \n(1992). This Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he second and third standing \nrequirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often flip sides of the same coin. If \nthe defendant\u2019s actions cause an injury, enjoining that action or awarding damages \nfor the action will typically redress that injury.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL \n2964140, at *6 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThis Court applied that clear connection between causation and redressability \nin its analysis of Reed\u2019s standing in challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-\nconviction DNA statute. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, straightforwardly \nexplained: \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nrequested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, \n\n \n17 \n \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a \nfederal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the \nstate prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying testing. It is substantially \nlikely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234 (quotation omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe practical \nconsequences of that change [in law] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. \n(quotation omitted). Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s analysis of Reed\u2019s standing was clear, \ndirect, and easy to apply.  \nThis Court has advised that when courts have unanswered questions about \nstanding, they should look to similarly situated defendants for guidance: \u201cThe \n\u2018absence of precise definitions\u2019 has not left courts entirely at sea in applying the law \nof standing. Like \u2018most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable \ndefinition from developing case law.\u2019\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at \n*8 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). \u201cIn \u2018many cases the standing \nquestion can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u2013\n52). \nThe dissent below recognized that Gutierrez\u2019s case was in virtually the same \nposition as Reed. A16. The dissent\u2019s analysis was simple and followed this Court\u2019s \ndirective that, when it comes to standing, similarly situated litigants should be \ntreated the same. \n\n \n18 \n \nIn contrast, the panel majority did not look at the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s \ncomplaint and compare them to the allegations in Reed\u2019s complaint, despite both \nparties having filed 28(j) letters with the Fifth Circuit to address the impact of Reed \nhere. If it had, the majority would have seen that the allegation in Gutierrez\u2014that \nChapter 64 violates due process\u2014was identical to the allegation in Reed. Moreover, \nthe defendants in both cases were equivalent state officials, and the requested relief \nwas identical. The majority nonetheless failed to follow this Court\u2019s clear directive to \nanswer the standing question \u201cchiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u201d Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u201352. The \nmajority instead dispensed with the principle that standing applies equally to \nsimilarly situated parties and replaced it with a burdensome requirement that will \nhereupon individualize a plaintiff\u2019s standing. Under the majority\u2019s approach, \nstanding will now depend on how particular state officials\u2014or any federal \ndefendants\u2014may act in the future following a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  \nWhat is especially egregious about the Fifth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \nReed, however, is that the court\u2019s premise that Reed\u2019s posture in the CCA was \ndifferent than Gutierrez\u2019s posture is glaringly wrong. The panel majority postulated \nthat, \u201c[i]f Reed is to be distinguished from this case, we need to determine if the Court \nof Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations violated federal law, \nthat Reed\u2019s claim would fail.\u201d A13. The majority then concluded that the CCA had \nbeen silent on this question and distinguished Reed on the ground that \u201c[t]he Texas \n\n \n19 \n \ncourt made no holding in Reed comparable to its holding in Gutierrez.\u201d A13\u2013A14 n. 4. \nThe majority erred because its chosen distinction contradicts the events of Reed.  \nIn order to obtain DNA testing, Reed, like Gutierrez here, would still need to \nsatisfy all the requirements of Chapter 64, including that \u201cthe request for the \nproposed DNA testing is not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or \nadministration of justice.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(2)(B). The trial \ncourt found that Reed did not meet this requirement for seven distinct reasons. See \nReed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). On appeal, the CCA \naffirmed, \u201chold[ing] that Reed failed to establish that his request is not made to \nunreasonably delay the execution of his sentence or the administration of justice.\u201d Id. \nat 778. The CCA\u2019s analysis of why Reed cannot get relief because he cannot satisfy \n\u00a7 64.03(a)(2)(B) spans three pages\u2014far beyond the two sentences of dicta in the CCA\u2019s \nGutierrez opinions that the Fifth Circuit relied on here. The CCA thus squarely held \nthat Reed cannot obtain DNA testing for reasons that have nothing to do with the \nDNA statute\u2019s chain-of-custody limitations that Reed challenged in federal court. \nThis Court nonetheless held that Reed had standing because his complaints about \nChapter 64 were potentially redressable. The record in Reed thus refutes the \nmajority\u2019s attempt to distinguish it from this case.   \n \nThe Fifth Circuit may not disregard this Court\u2019s determinations and legal \nprecedents to strain for a result that it prefers. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-\nCruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a lower \ncourt in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it \n\n \n20 \n \nis essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court \ndecisions.\u201d); Winslow v. FERC, 587 F.3d 1133, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(\u201cVertical stare decisis\u2014both in letter and in spirit\u2014is a critical aspect of our \nhierarchical Judiciary headed by \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Const. art. III \n\u00a7 1)).  \nReversal of the Fifth Circuit is necessary to ensure adherence to this Court\u2019s \nconstitutional holdings, consistent application of a bedrock legal standard, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. See, e.g., James v. City of Boise, 577 U.S. 406, 307 (2016) \n(granting summary reversal and emphasizing that lower courts are \u201cbound by this \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Federal law\u201d); Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.S. 385, 395 (2016) (per \ncuriam) (noting that this Court \u201chas not shied away from deciding fact-intensive cases \nwhere, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law\u201d); Marmet \nHealth Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532 (2012) (per curiam) (granting \nsummary reversal where lower court\u2019s interpretation of federal law \u201cwas both \nincorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court\u201d). In \ncreating a novel requirement that conflicts with Reed, the Fifth Circuit majority has \nignored established Supreme Court precedent and created a circuit split where none \nshould exist. This Court should grant certiorari. \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant the writ of certiorari \nand stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in that court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n \nDated:  June 25, 2024",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex.

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigation in another case raising spiritual-advisor claims similar \nto Gutierrez\u2019s. Order Vacating Order, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt. Cameron Cnty., Sept. 21, 2015); see Ramirez v. Collier, No. 21-5592, 2021 WL \n4129220, at *1 (Sept. 10, 2021). \n\n10 \n \nthe absence in Chapter 64 of a provision for punishment-related DNA testing.5 \nMem. & Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, \n2021), ECF No. 141. The district court later entered a partial final judgment \nas to Gutierrez\u2019s DNA claims, which dismissed or denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s \nchallenges to Chapter 64 other than the one as to which the court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment. Order 4, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. \nDec. 8, 2021), ECF No. 188. Respondents appealed the district court\u2019s \ndeclaratory judgment.  \nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit held Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the \ndeclaratory judgment the district court granted. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 \nF.4th at 275. The Fifth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and \nremanded the case for the complaint to be dismissed. Id. The Fifth Circuit \ndenied Gutierrez\u2019s petition for rehearing and his motion to stay issuance of \nmandate.6 Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al, No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. June 7, \n2024), ECF No. 148-2; On Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. May 29, 2024), ECF No. 138-\n \n5  \nRespondents appealed the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, but the appeal \nwas dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70002 \n(5th Cir. June 24, 2021). \n \n6  \nThe district court has since dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s complaint. Order, Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133. He obtained a stay of his \nfederal habeas proceedings while he litigated his first request for postconviction DNA \ntesting and a subsequent state habeas application. Order, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019. See Mot. to Withdraw and for Appointment \nof Sub. Counsel 4, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018); \nComplaint, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2019). And \nhe repeatedly sought to delay the district court\u2019s resolution of his civil rights lawsuit. \nOrder, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 7, 2020) (order \nstaying proceedings pending TCCA\u2019s resolution of Gutierrez\u2019s second Chapter 64 \nappeal); Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex.

Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

Successfully extracting key arguments from the petition will reinforce the design principle that analyzing core filings (Petition, Brief in Opposition, etc.) is a non-negotiable and highly effective step. It helps refine the strategy of when and how to transition from broad exploration to deep-diving into specific legal arguments.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because this action is essential for both understanding the specifics of this case and for validating a core component of the legal reasoning process.",

No. 58; and Gutierrez's\nAugust\n3,\n2018, reply to the response,\nDkt.\nNo.\n62.\nThe\nCourt GRANTS\nSchmucker's motion to withdraw and APPOINTS Attorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill,\n(\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. The Court further (1) ORDERS Gutierrez to\nrequest the appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation no\nlater than August 10, 2018, should he intend to request such appointment; and (2)\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nI.\nBackground\nOn\nSeptember\n15,\n2008, the\nCourt appointed\nSchmucker to represent\nGutierrez in his federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to\n18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599.\nGutierrez v. Quarterman, l:08-mc-008, Dkt. No. 5. The Court denied Gutierrez's\npetition on October 3, 2013. Dkt. No. 44. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on November\n13, 2014, Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App'x 371 (5th Cir. 2014), and the United\nStates Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari review, Gutierrez v. Stephens,\n_ U.S._, 136 S. Ct. 35 (2015). The State of Texas has set Gutierrez's execution\nfor September 12, 2018.\n1 / 6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 6\nSchmucker has moved to substitute counsel with only weeks remammg\nbefore the execution date. See Dkt. No. 56. On July 27, 2018, the Court ordered\nPetitioner to file a certificate of consent signed by Gutierrez or provide another\nindication that Gutierrez has been informed of, and consents to, a change in\nrepresentation. Dkt. No. 59. The record suggests that Gutierrez consents to a\nchange in representation. See Dkt. No. 62 at 1-2. The motion to substitute counsel\nis\nbased\non\nSchmucker's\nability to\nprovide\ncompetent representation\nbefore\nGutierrez's execution. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. The motion argues that Schmucker lacks\nthe experience necessary to litigate effectively the challenges Gutierrez anticipates\nraising in the\nshort time before his execution date. Id.\nThe motion further\nrepresents that,\neven\nif Schmucker\ncould provide adequate\nlegal assistance,\nSchmucker can no longer practice in the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel. Id. at 5\n(citing In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15, 2017)). The motion proposes\nappointing the Capital Habeas Unit ('CHU\") from the Federal Defender's Office in\nthe Western District of Texas. Id. at 5-6. The motion represents that the CHU\ncurrently lacks the resources to provide adequate representation to Gutierrez, but\nwould try to find new counsel to do so. Id. at 6.\nRespondent opposes the substitution of counsel. Dkt. No. 58. Respondent\nargues that Gutierrez unjustifiably delayed filing his motion until a stay of the\nexecution date would be inevitable. Id. at 36. Respondent also argues that\nSchmucker is sufficiently experienced to draft any future pleadings and that any\nlast-minute litigation would lack merit. Id. at 6-10. Recognizing that Schmucker\ncan no longer appear before the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel, Respondent\nasserts that she can still \"practic[e] in the Fifth Circuit as non-[Criminal Justice\nAct] counsel.\" Id. at 10.\nSchmucker filed a reply to Respondent's opposition. Dkt. No. 62. Schmucker\ndoes\nnot\nprovide\nany\ncertificate\nof\nconsent\nindicating\nGutierrez's assent to\nsubstitution, but she affirms that she discussed the need for additional counsel with\nGutierrez\non July\n13,\n2018,\nand that both\nGutierrez\nand\nSchmucker have\n\"attempted to find qualified counsel\" since that time. Id. at\n1-2. Schmucker\n2/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 6\nrepresents that\nshe has\n\"made\nmultiple attempts to\ncommunicate\nwith Mr.\nGutierrez by phone and express mail in order to discuss the matter\n[of her\nwithdrawal and substitution following the Court's July 27, 2018, Order] and obtain\nclarity as to [Gutierrez's] wishes.\" Id. at 2-3. However, Schmucker represents that\nshe \"has been unsuccessful in [her] attempts [at communication with Gutierrez] but\nwill advise the Court if and when [she successfully communicates with her client].\"\nId. at 3. Schmucker responds that she has not delayed in bringing the instant\nmatter to the Court's attention, but other commitments have consumed her time.\nId. at 5-7. Schmucker argues that her disqualification in the Fifth Circuit does not\nimpinge on her qualifications, only her practical ability to litigate in that court. Id.\nat 4-5.\nEven so, Schmucker expresses concern that she lacks sufficient experience\nto litigate a last-minute complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983 that she has\ndrafted, but not filed, on Gutierrez's behalf. Id. at 4-5. Schmucker argues that\nappointment of co-counsel who \"is more familiar with\u00a7 1983 suits and who is on the\nFifth Circuit's [Criminal Justice Act] panel would largely ameliorate the concerns\nunderlying the pending motion to withdraw.\" Id. at 4.\nThe Court considers Parties' filings.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a court should substitute an\nattorney when necessary in the \"interests of justice.\" Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648,\n663\n(2012). This \"peculiarly context-specific inquiry\" involves \"several relevant\nconsiderations,\" including: \"the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district\ncourt's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and the asserted cause for that\ncomplaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\nbetween lawyer and client (and the client's own responsibility, if any, for that\nconflict).\"\nId.; see also Mendoza v. Stephens, 783 F.3d 203, 208 (5th Cir. 2015)\n(relying on the Martel considerations).\nFederal law guarantees that an inmate facing a death sentence will have the\nprotection afforded by appointed counsel. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599. Once a court\nappoints an attorney under \u00a7 3599, that attorney \"shall represent the defendant\n3/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 6\nthroughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\" unless that\nattorney is \"replaced by similarly qualified counsel.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e) (emphasis\nadded).\nSchmucker's\nappointment\ncreated an\nobligation\nfor her to represent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\n\"all\navailable\npost-conviction\nprocess,\ntogether\nwith\napplications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\"\nas\nwell\nas\n\"competency\nproceedings\nand proceedings\nfor\nexecutive\nor\nother\nclemency.\" Id.; see also Wilkins v. Davis, 832 F.3d 547, 557 (5th Cir. 2016).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nWhen Schmucker applied to join the Criminal Justice Act panel and accepted\nclients in death penalty-related matters, including this one, she explicitly and\nimplicitly represented that she has the qualifications and experience necessary to\nlitigate this case. The present circumstances, however, prevent Schmucker from\nfulfilling her obligations to her client.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Fifth Circuit entered an order \"disqualifying\n[Schmucker] from performing work pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act ... in\ncases before\n[that]\ncourt as a result of a pattern of rude and unprofessional\ncommunications with court staff.\" In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15,\n2017). It was incumbent on Schmucker to inform this Court of that discipline, but\nshe did not do so. See Rule 9, Rules of Discipline, United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas, Local Rules (\"A lawyer disciplined by another court\nin the United States shall promptly notify this court in writing and furnish to the\nclerk\nof the\ncourt\na\ncertified\ncopy\nof the\norder\nof discipline.\").\nOnly now,\napproximately seven months after her discipline and with little time remammg\nbefore execution, has Schmucker advised the Court of her discipline.\nThe pleadings suggest that Schmucker has made some efforts to prepare for\nGutierrez's execution, but has not filed any pleadings despite quickly approaching\ndue dates for matters such as filing a clemency petition. The motion to substitute\nrepresents that potential remedies which may exist for Gutierrez include a civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. Litigation of such an\naction, and other possible litigation strategies such as a stay of execution or\n4/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 5 of 6\nsuccessive federal petition, would require an attorney who can represent Gutierrez\nin the Fifth Circuit. Schmucker's continued representation of Gutierrez would\npreclude her client from availing himself of potential avenues of relief. Gutierrez\nwould effectively be left with \"no counsel at all\" for the purposes of any appeal.\nMartel, 132 S. Ct. at 1286; see also Christeson v. Roper,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 891,\n895 (2015) (finding that a conflict of interests left an inmate effectively without\ncounsel).1\nWhile \"the delay in seeking substitution ... might be [a] valid consideration[]\n[weighing against substitution of counsel] in many cases,\" Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at\n895, the fact that Schmucker's continued representation would leave Gutierrez\nwithout access to an appellate attorney weighs heavily in favor of granting the\nmotion to substitute.\nGutierrez bears no responsibility for the fact that his\nappointed counsel can no longer practice before the Fifth Circuit.\nWith Gutierrez's execution fast approaching, the Court FINDS that the\ninterests\nof justice require the\nsubstitution of counsel.\nThe\nCourt, therefore,\nGRANTS Gutierrez's\nmotion to withdraw and ORDERS the\nsubstitution\nof\ncounsel. Dkt. No. 56.\nThe motion to substitute represents that Schmucker has attempted to secure\nassistance in representing Gutierrez. Id. at 5-6. While this matter should have been\nbrought to the Court's attention long before, the Court has expeditiously found\nqualified and competent counsel willing to represent Gutierrez. The Court hereby\nAPPOINTS the following attorney to represent Gutierrez:\nRichard W. Rogers, III\n710 Buffalo Street, Suite 202\nCorpus Christi, TX 78401\n361-888-7620\nFax: 361-888-7619\nEmail: rwrogersiii@aol.com\n1\nRespondent does not elaborate on how Schmucker could appear before the Fifth Circuit as \"non\u00ad\n[Criminal Justice Act] counsel,\" Dkt. No. 58 at 10, and does not provide any law that would\nauthorize her to appear forthwith on a pro bono basis.\n5/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 6 of 6\nRogers will be\ncompensated at the maximum rate pursuant to\n18 U.S.C\n}\n3599(g)(l). Rogers may submit requests for interim payment for his work. Rogers\nwill\nrepresent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\nevery\nsubsequent\nstage\nof\navailable\nproceedings.\nUnder federal law, a capital inmate \"shall be entitled to the appointment of\none or more attorneys.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2). Should Gutierrez intend to request\nthe appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation, the Court\nORDERS him to make such a request no later than August 10, 2018.\nThe\nCourt notes that,\ngiven the\nshort timeline\nbefore the\nscheduled\nexecution, it is possible that the substitution of counsel may only be given effect by\na stay. This Court has the authority to grant a stay of execution. Battaglia v.\nStephens,\n824\nF.3d\n470,\n475\n(5th\nCir.\n2016).\nHowever,\nbecause\na\nprisoner\ncondemned to death has no automatic entitlement to a stay of execution, see\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 858 (1994), the Court will address the question of\na stay if and when it is fully briefed by the parties. To that end, the Court\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nIV.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Court:\n\u2022\nGRANTS Gutierrez's Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of\nSubstitute Counsel, Dkt. No. 56;\n\u2022\nAPPOINTS Rogers as substitute counsel;\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to request the appointment of an additional attorney to\naid in his representation no later than August 10, 2018, should he intend to\nrequest such appointment; and\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15,\n2018.\nSIGNED this 6th day ofAugust, 2018b~\nHilda Tagle\n~\nSenior United States District Judge\n6/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 1 of 4\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of Texas\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nBROWNSVILLE DIVISION\nENTERED\nAugust 14, 2018\nDavid J. Bradley, Clerk\nRUBEN GUTIERREZ,\nPetitioner,\nvs.\nLORIE DAVIS,\nRespondent.\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nCIVIL NO. 1:09-CV-00022\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nORDER\nBefore the Court are Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez's (\"Gutierrez\") August 10,\n2018, opposed Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 66; Respondent Lorie Davis'\n(\"Davis\") August 13, 2018, Opposition to Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 69;\nand Gutierrez's August 14, 2018, reply to the opposition, Dkt. No. 70.\nThe Court\nGRANTS Gutierrez's motion and CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal\nCommunity Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\"FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA'') as co-counsel in this case.\nI.\nBackground\nOn August 6, 2018, the Court granted Attorney Margaret Schmucker's\n(\"Schmucker\") motion to withdraw from representing Gutierrez and appointed\nAttorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill, (\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. Dkt. No. 63. The\nmotion to substitute counsel indicated that potential remedies which may exist for\nGutierrez include filing a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nRecognizing\nthat federal law entitles death-row inmates to the appointment of more than one\nattorney, the Court ordered Gutierrez to request the assistance of an additional\nattorney by August 10, 2018. Petitioner now seeks to the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA as Rogers' co-counsel. Dkt. No. 66.\nSuch appointment would be conditioned\non the FCDO-EDPA receiving approval to pursue out-of-district representation from\n(1) the Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, and (2) Fifth Circuit Chief Judge Carl E. Stewart. Id. at 4.\n1/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 4\nDavis opposes the appointment of co-counsel.\nDkt. No. 69. Respondent\nprovides four reasons for objecting to FCDO-EDPA serving as co-counsel:\n(1)\nRespondent objects to any delay that would result from the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA, id. at 2-3; (2) Respondent contends that no conflict of interest exists between\nGutierrez\nand\nRogers requiring the\nsubstitution\nof counsel,\nid.\nat\n3-4;\n(3)\nRespondent argues that appointed counsel does not have a statutory right to file a\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and thus additional attorneys for the preparation of\nthat lawsuit are not necessary, id. at 4-5; and (4) the interests of justice do not\nrequire the appointment of counsel to assist in a \u00a7 1983 case which is \"an extremely\nlimited proceeding,\" id. at 5.\nGutierrez filed a reply to Davis' opposition.\nDkt. No. 70.\nGutierrez replies\nthat any delay is not his fault, but that of Schmucker for failing to bring problems\nwith her representation before the Court in a timely manner. Id. at 1-2. Gutierrez\nargues that Davis relies on an incorrect standard when opposing the appointment of\nco-counsel. Id. at 2. Likewise, Gutierrez contends that Davis presents a constricted\nview of the responsibilities of co-counsel which will encompass more than assisting\nin a civil rights action. Id. at 3. Even under the standards propounded by Davis,\nhowever, Gutierrez argues that he has an entitlement to co-counsel under the law.\nId. at 1-4.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nFederal law entitles Gutierrez \"to the appointment of one or more attorneys .\n\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599a)(1); see also McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 (1994)\n(finding,\nunder\na\nformer\nstatute, that federal\nlaw\n\"grants\nindigent\ncapital\ndefendants a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel\").\nThe governing statute\ndoes not necessarily require the appointment of more than one attorney. After the\nappointment of one qualified attorney, \"the court, for good cause, may appoint\nanother attorney whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise\nenable him or her to properly represent the defendant, with due consideration to the\nseriousness of the possible penalty and to the unique and complex nature of the\nlitigation.\"\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(d) (emphasis added).\nHowever, the federal court's\n2/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 4\nGuide to Judiciary Policy contemplates that \"[d]ue to the complex, demanding,\nand protracted nature of death penalty proceedings, judicial officers should consider\nappointing at least two attorneys.\" Vol. 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy\u00a7 620.10. 20b)\n(emphasis added).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nRespondent asks the court to apply the interests-of-justice standard when\ndeciding whether to appoint co-counsel in this action. Dkt. 69 at 2-5; see Christeson\nv. Roper,\nU.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 891, 894 (2015) (applying interests-of-justice\nstandard to motions to substitute counsel); Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 663 (2012)\n(same).\nUnder statutory law, however, Gutierrez only needs to show \"good cause\"\nfor the appointment of another attorney.\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).\nFederal judicial\npolicy presumes that the complex nature of capital representation itself present\ngood cause for representation by at least two attorneys.\nRespondent also objects that the court should not appoint counsel because it\nappears that Gutierrez will soon litigate a civil rights action. Respondent contends\nthe filing of that lawsuit should not require the services of more than one attorney.\nThe appointment of co-counsel, however, is not limited to that one task. Once a\ncourt appoints an attorney under\n\u00a7\n3599, that attorney \"shall represent the\ndefendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings ....\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599(e).\nCo-counsel will have a responsibility to represent Gutierrez\nthroughout \"all available post-conviction process, together with applications for\nstays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\" as well as\n\"competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency.\"\nId.\nWhile the filing of a civil rights action is foreseeable, so are other possible avenues\nof relief such as a motion for a stay of execution, state clemency, and successive\nhabeas proceedings.\nRespondent's narrow view of appointment does not fully\ncapture the possible work co-counsel may perform.\nReviewing the pleadings and the law, and in consideration of the possible\nremedies available to Gutierrez, the Court finds that Gutierrez has shown good\ncause for the appointment of co-counsel.\n3/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 4\nIV.\nConclusion\nAccordingly, the Court \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Petitioner is indigent; he has sought and been \nappointed counsel throughout the proceedings below in state and federal court. \n \nAs to his federal proceedings, on September 15, 2008, the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas appointed Margaret Schmucker as \ncounsel pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, Mr. Gutierrez \n\n2 \n \nhaving satisfied the court that he was unable to employ counsel and did not wish to \nwaive counsel.

Bradley, Clerk\nRUBEN GUTIERREZ,\nPetitioner,\nvs.\nLORIE DAVIS,\nRespondent.\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nCIVIL NO. 1:09-CV-00022\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nORDER\nBefore the Court are Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez's (\"Gutierrez\") July 24,\n2018, Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of Substitute Counsel filed\nby\nappointed\ncounsel\nMargaret\nSchmucker\n(\"Schmucker\"),\nDkt.\nNo.\n56;\nRespondent's July 27, 2018, response to the motion, Dkt. No. 58; and Gutierrez's\nAugust\n3,\n2018, reply to the response,\nDkt.\nNo.\n62.\nThe\nCourt GRANTS\nSchmucker's motion to withdraw and APPOINTS Attorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill,\n(\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. The Court further (1) ORDERS Gutierrez to\nrequest the appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation no\nlater than August 10, 2018, should he intend to request such appointment; and (2)\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nI.\nBackground\nOn\nSeptember\n15,\n2008, the\nCourt appointed\nSchmucker to represent\nGutierrez in his federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to\n18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599.\nGutierrez v. Quarterman, l:08-mc-008, Dkt. No. 5. The Court denied Gutierrez's\npetition on October 3, 2013. Dkt. No. 44. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on November\n13, 2014, Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App'x 371 (5th Cir. 2014), and the United\nStates Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari review, Gutierrez v. Stephens,\n_ U.S._, 136 S. Ct. 35 (2015). The State of Texas has set Gutierrez's execution\nfor September 12, 2018.\n1 / 6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 6\nSchmucker has moved to substitute counsel with only weeks remammg\nbefore the execution date. See Dkt. No. 56. On July 27, 2018, the Court ordered\nPetitioner to file a certificate of consent signed by Gutierrez or provide another\nindication that Gutierrez has been informed of, and consents to, a change in\nrepresentation. Dkt. No. 59. The record suggests that Gutierrez consents to a\nchange in representation. See Dkt. No. 62 at 1-2. The motion to substitute counsel\nis\nbased\non\nSchmucker's\nability to\nprovide\ncompetent representation\nbefore\nGutierrez's execution. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. The motion argues that Schmucker lacks\nthe experience necessary to litigate effectively the challenges Gutierrez anticipates\nraising in the\nshort time before his execution date. Id.\nThe motion further\nrepresents that,\neven\nif Schmucker\ncould provide adequate\nlegal assistance,\nSchmucker can no longer practice in the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel. Id. at 5\n(citing In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15, 2017)). The motion proposes\nappointing the Capital Habeas Unit ('CHU\") from the Federal Defender's Office in\nthe Western District of Texas. Id. at 5-6. The motion represents that the CHU\ncurrently lacks the resources to provide adequate representation to Gutierrez, but\nwould try to find new counsel to do so. Id. at 6.\nRespondent opposes the substitution of counsel. Dkt. No. 58. Respondent\nargues that Gutierrez unjustifiably delayed filing his motion until a stay of the\nexecution date would be inevitable. Id. at 36. Respondent also argues that\nSchmucker is sufficiently experienced to draft any future pleadings and that any\nlast-minute litigation would lack merit. Id. at 6-10. Recognizing that Schmucker\ncan no longer appear before the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel, Respondent\nasserts that she can still \"practic[e] in the Fifth Circuit as non-[Criminal Justice\nAct] counsel.\" Id. at 10.\nSchmucker filed a reply to Respondent's opposition. Dkt. No. 62. Schmucker\ndoes\nnot\nprovide\nany\ncertificate\nof\nconsent\nindicating\nGutierrez's assent to\nsubstitution, but she affirms that she discussed the need for additional counsel with\nGutierrez\non July\n13,\n2018,\nand that both\nGutierrez\nand\nSchmucker have\n\"attempted to find qualified counsel\" since that time. Id. at\n1-2. Schmucker\n2/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 6\nrepresents that\nshe has\n\"made\nmultiple attempts to\ncommunicate\nwith Mr.\nGutierrez by phone and express mail in order to discuss the matter\n[of her\nwithdrawal and substitution following the Court's July 27, 2018, Order] and obtain\nclarity as to [Gutierrez's] wishes.\" Id. at 2-3. However, Schmucker represents that\nshe \"has been unsuccessful in [her] attempts [at communication with Gutierrez] but\nwill advise the Court if and when [she successfully communicates with her client].\"\nId. at 3. Schmucker responds that she has not delayed in bringing the instant\nmatter to the Court's attention, but other commitments have consumed her time.\nId. at 5-7. Schmucker argues that her disqualification in the Fifth Circuit does not\nimpinge on her qualifications, only her practical ability to litigate in that court. Id.\nat 4-5.\nEven so, Schmucker expresses concern that she lacks sufficient experience\nto litigate a last-minute complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983 that she has\ndrafted, but not filed, on Gutierrez's behalf. Id. at 4-5. Schmucker argues that\nappointment of co-counsel who \"is more familiar with\u00a7 1983 suits and who is on the\nFifth Circuit's [Criminal Justice Act] panel would largely ameliorate the concerns\nunderlying the pending motion to withdraw.\" Id. at 4.\nThe Court considers Parties' filings.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a court should substitute an\nattorney when necessary in the \"interests of justice.\" Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648,\n663\n(2012). This \"peculiarly context-specific inquiry\" involves \"several relevant\nconsiderations,\" including: \"the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district\ncourt's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and the asserted cause for that\ncomplaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\nbetween lawyer and client (and the client's own responsibility, if any, for that\nconflict).\"\nId.; see also Mendoza v. Stephens, 783 F.3d 203, 208 (5th Cir. 2015)\n(relying on the Martel considerations).\nFederal law guarantees that an inmate facing a death sentence will have the\nprotection afforded by appointed counsel. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599. Once a court\nappoints an attorney under \u00a7 3599, that attorney \"shall represent the defendant\n3/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 6\nthroughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\" unless that\nattorney is \"replaced by similarly qualified counsel.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e) (emphasis\nadded).\nSchmucker's\nappointment\ncreated an\nobligation\nfor her to represent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\n\"all\navailable\npost-conviction\nprocess,\ntogether\nwith\napplications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\"\nas\nwell\nas\n\"competency\nproceedings\nand proceedings\nfor\nexecutive\nor\nother\nclemency.\" Id.; see also Wilkins v. Davis, 832 F.3d 547, 557 (5th Cir. 2016).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nWhen Schmucker applied to join the Criminal Justice Act panel and accepted\nclients in death penalty-related matters, including this one, she explicitly and\nimplicitly represented that she has the qualifications and experience necessary to\nlitigate this case. The present circumstances, however, prevent Schmucker from\nfulfilling her obligations to her client.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Fifth Circuit entered an order \"disqualifying\n[Schmucker] from performing work pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act ... in\ncases before\n[that]\ncourt as a result of a pattern of rude and unprofessional\ncommunications with court staff.\" In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15,\n2017). It was incumbent on Schmucker to inform this Court of that discipline, but\nshe did not do so. See Rule 9, Rules of Discipline, United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas, Local Rules (\"A lawyer disciplined by another court\nin the United States shall promptly notify this court in writing and furnish to the\nclerk\nof the\ncourt\na\ncertified\ncopy\nof the\norder\nof discipline.\").\nOnly now,\napproximately seven months after her discipline and with little time remammg\nbefore execution, has Schmucker advised the Court of her discipline.\nThe pleadings suggest that Schmucker has made some efforts to prepare for\nGutierrez's execution, but has not filed any pleadings despite quickly approaching\ndue dates for matters such as filing a clemency petition. The motion to substitute\nrepresents that potential remedies which may exist for Gutierrez include a civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. Litigation of such an\naction, and other possible litigation strategies such as a stay of execution or\n4/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 5 of 6\nsuccessive federal petition, would require an attorney who can represent Gutierrez\nin the Fifth Circuit. Schmucker's continued representation of Gutierrez would\npreclude her client from availing himself of potential avenues of relief. Gutierrez\nwould effectively be left with \"no counsel at all\" for the purposes of any appeal.\nMartel, 132 S. Ct. at 1286; see also Christeson v. Roper,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 891,\n895 (2015) (finding that a conflict of interests left an inmate effectively without\ncounsel).1\nWhile \"the delay in seeking substitution ... might be [a] valid consideration[]\n[weighing against substitution of counsel] in many cases,\" Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at\n895, the fact that Schmucker's continued representation would leave Gutierrez\nwithout access to an appellate attorney weighs heavily in favor of granting the\nmotion to substitute.\nGutierrez bears no responsibility for the fact that his\nappointed counsel can no longer practice before the Fifth Circuit.\nWith Gutierrez's execution fast approaching, the Court FINDS that the\ninterests\nof justice require the\nsubstitution of counsel.\nThe\nCourt, therefore,\nGRANTS Gutierrez's\nmotion to withdraw and ORDERS the\nsubstitution\nof\ncounsel. Dkt. No. 56.\nThe motion to substitute represents that Schmucker has attempted to secure\nassistance in representing Gutierrez. Id. at 5-6. While this matter should have been\nbrought to the Court's attention long before, the Court has expeditiously found\nqualified and competent counsel willing to represent Gutierrez. The Court hereby\nAPPOINTS the following attorney to represent Gutierrez:\nRichard W. Rogers, III\n710 Buffalo Street, Suite 202\nCorpus Christi, TX 78401\n361-888-7620\nFax: 361-888-7619\nEmail: rwrogersiii@aol.com\n1\nRespondent does not elaborate on how Schmucker could appear before the Fifth Circuit as \"non\u00ad\n[Criminal Justice Act] counsel,\" Dkt. No. 58 at 10, and does not provide any law that would\nauthorize her to appear forthwith on a pro bono basis.\n5/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 6 of 6\nRogers will be\ncompensated at the maximum rate pursuant to\n18 U.S.C\n}\n3599(g)(l). Rogers may submit requests for interim payment for his work. Rogers\nwill\nrepresent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\nevery\nsubsequent\nstage\nof\navailable\nproceedings.\nUnder federal law, a capital inmate \"shall be entitled to the appointment of\none or more attorneys.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2). Should Gutierrez intend to request\nthe appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation, the Court\nORDERS him to make such a request no later than August 10, 2018.\nThe\nCourt notes that,\ngiven the\nshort timeline\nbefore the\nscheduled\nexecution, it is possible that the substitution of counsel may only be given effect by\na stay. This Court has the authority to grant a stay of execution. Battaglia v.\nStephens,\n824\nF.3d\n470,\n475\n(5th\nCir.\n2016).\nHowever,\nbecause\na\nprisoner\ncondemned to death has no automatic entitlement to a stay of execution, see\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 858 (1994), the Court will address the question of\na stay if and when it is fully briefed by the parties. To that end, the Court\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nIV.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Court:\n\u2022\nGRANTS Gutierrez's Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of\nSubstitute Counsel, Dkt. No. 56;\n\u2022\nAPPOINTS Rogers as substitute counsel;\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to request the appointment of an additional attorney to\naid in his representation no later than August 10, 2018, should he intend to\nrequest such appointment; and\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15,\n2018.\nSIGNED this 6th day ofAugust, 2018b~\nHilda Tagle\n~\nSenior United States District Judge\n6/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 1 of 4\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of Texas\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nBROWNSVILLE DIVISION\nENTERED\nAugust 14, 2018\nDavid J. Bradley, Clerk\nRUBEN GUTIERREZ,\nPetitioner,\nvs.\nLORIE DAVIS,\nRespondent.\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nCIVIL NO. 1:09-CV-00022\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nORDER\nBefore the Court are Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez's (\"Gutierrez\") August 10,\n2018, opposed Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 66; Respondent Lorie Davis'\n(\"Davis\") August 13, 2018, Opposition to Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 69;\nand Gutierrez's August 14, 2018, reply to the opposition, Dkt. No. 70.\nThe Court\nGRANTS Gutierrez's motion and CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal\nCommunity Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\"FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA'') as co-counsel in this case.\nI.\nBackground\nOn August 6, 2018, the Court granted Attorney Margaret Schmucker's\n(\"Schmucker\") motion to withdraw from representing Gutierrez and appointed\nAttorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill, (\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. Dkt. No. 63. The\nmotion to substitute counsel indicated that potential remedies which may exist for\nGutierrez include filing a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nRecognizing\nthat federal law entitles death-row inmates to the appointment of more than one\nattorney, the Court ordered Gutierrez to request the assistance of an additional\nattorney by August 10, 2018. Petitioner now seeks to the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA as Rogers' co-counsel. Dkt. No. 66.\nSuch appointment would be conditioned\non the FCDO-EDPA receiving approval to pursue out-of-district representation from\n(1) the Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, and (2) Fifth Circuit Chief Judge Carl E. Stewart. Id. at 4.\n1/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 4\nDavis opposes the appointment of co-counsel.\nDkt. No. 69. Respondent\nprovides four reasons for objecting to FCDO-EDPA serving as co-counsel:\n(1)\nRespondent objects to any delay that would result from the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA, id. at 2-3; (2) Respondent contends that no conflict of interest exists between\nGutierrez\nand\nRogers requiring the\nsubstitution\nof counsel,\nid.\nat\n3-4;\n(3)\nRespondent argues that appointed counsel does not have a statutory right to file a\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and thus additional attorneys for the preparation of\nthat lawsuit are not necessary, id. at 4-5; and (4) the interests of justice do not\nrequire the appointment of counsel to assist in a \u00a7 1983 case which is \"an extremely\nlimited proceeding,\" id. at 5.\nGutierrez filed a reply to Davis' opposition.\nDkt. No. 70.\nGutierrez replies\nthat any delay is not his fault, but that of Schmucker for failing to bring problems\nwith her representation before the Court in a timely manner. Id. at 1-2. Gutierrez\nargues that Davis relies on an incorrect standard when opposing the appointment of\nco-counsel. Id. at 2. Likewise, Gutierrez contends that Davis presents a constricted\nview of the responsibilities of co-counsel which will encompass more than assisting\nin a civil rights action. Id. at 3. Even under the standards propounded by Davis,\nhowever, Gutierrez argues that he has an entitlement to co-counsel under the law.\nId. at 1-4.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nFederal law entitles Gutierrez \"to the appointment of one or more attorneys .\n\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599a)(1); see also McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 (1994)\n(finding,\nunder\na\nformer\nstatute, that federal\nlaw\n\"grants\nindigent\ncapital\ndefendants a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel\").\nThe governing statute\ndoes not necessarily require the appointment of more than one attorney. After the\nappointment of one qualified attorney, \"the court, for good cause, may appoint\nanother attorney whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise\nenable him or her to properly represent the defendant, with due consideration to the\nseriousness of the possible penalty and to the unique and complex nature of the\nlitigation.\"\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(d) (emphasis added).\nHowever, the federal court's\n2/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 4\nGuide to Judiciary Policy contemplates that \"[d]ue to the complex, demanding,\nand protracted nature of death penalty proceedings, judicial officers should consider\nappointing at least two attorneys.\" Vol. 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy\u00a7 620.10. 20b)\n(emphasis added).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nRespondent asks the court to apply the interests-of-justice standard when\ndeciding whether to appoint co-counsel in this action. Dkt. 69 at 2-5; see Christeson\nv. Roper,\nU.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 891, 894 (2015) (applying interests-of-justice\nstandard to motions to substitute counsel); Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 663 (2012)\n(same).\nUnder statutory law, however, Gutierrez only needs to show \"good cause\"\nfor the appointment of another attorney.\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).\nFederal judicial\npolicy presumes that the complex nature of capital representation itself present\ngood cause for representation by at least two attorneys.\nRespondent also objects that the court should not appoint counsel because it\nappears that Gutierrez will soon litigate a civil rights action. Respondent contends\nthe filing of that lawsuit should not require the services of more than one attorney.\nThe appointment of co-counsel, however, is not limited to that one task. Once a\ncourt appoints an attorney under\n\u00a7\n3599, that attorney \"shall represent the\ndefendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings ....\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599(e).\nCo-counsel will have a responsibility to represent Gutierrez\nthroughout \"all available post-conviction process, together with applications for\nstays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\" as well as\n\"competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency.\"\nId.\nWhile the filing of a civil rights action is foreseeable, so are other possible avenues\nof relief such as a motion for a stay of execution, state clemency, and successive\nhabeas proceedings.\nRespondent's narrow view of appointment does not fully\ncapture the possible work co-counsel may perform.\nReviewing the pleadings and the law, and in consideration of the possible\nremedies available to Gutierrez, the Court finds that Gutierrez has shown good\ncause for the appointment of co-counsel.\n3/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 4\nIV.\nConclusion\nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Gutierrez's Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel.\nDkt.\nNo.\n66.\nFinding that the\nrequested\nco-counsel\nmeets\nthe\nstatutory\nqualifications, the Court CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal Community\nDefender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as co-counsel pursuant to\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).1 The contact information for co-counsel is as follows:\nShawn Nolan, Chief\nCapital Habeas Unit\nFederal Community Defender\nEastern District of Pennsylvania\n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545\nWest Philadelphia, PA, 19106\n(215) 928-0520\nShawn_Nolan@fd.org\nThis appointment is effective upon the Defender Services Office's and the\nFifth Circuit Chief Judge's administrative approval of the FCDO-EDPA's request to\nseek an out-of-district appointment.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed. See Johnson v. \nGriffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). \nThe question presented is: \n \nDoes Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a \nspecific state official will redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by following a favorable \ndeclaratory judgment? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS IN LOWER FEDERAL COURTS \n \nSouthern District of Texas, Gutierrez v.

Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024 WL 2964140 (U.S. June 13, 2024), and \nReed, 598 U.S. 230.  \nI. \nTHE DECISION BELOW CREATES A CIRCUIT SPLIT BY \nREOPENING A QUESTON THAT THIS COURT SOUGHT TO \nSETTLE IN REED. \nCertiorari review is crucial when courts of appeals disagree about an area of \nfederal law. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a); see also Reed, 598 U.S.at 234 (certiorari granted to \nresolve circuit split regarding \u201cwhen the statute of limitations begins to run for a \n\u00a7 1983 suit regarding a State\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures\u201d). The need to \nresolve the circuit split in this case is particularly important because this Court had \nalready settled the precise standing issue before the Fifth Circuit, yet the Fifth \nCircuit opinion conflicts with that holding and creates an awkward new rule for \nstanding, requiring a pre-jurisdictional mini-trial to forecast the conduct of state \nofficials in response to a not-yet-issued declaratory judgment. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).  \nThe Fifth Circuit panel majority\u2019s rewriting of this Court\u2019s clearly established \nlaw should be addressed before additional circuit courts of appeals are faced with \ncases brought by plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions seeking declaratory judgments, and cases \nlooking to apply Reed\u2019s standing analysis generally.  \n\n \n12 \n \nA. \nThe Eighth Circuit \nThe majority\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 \n(8th Cir. 2023). Johnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in \nthe context of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional because it violates due process. Johnson, like Reed and Gutierrez, is \non death row, and sued the prosecuting attorney in his Arkansas county pursuant to \na \u00a7 1983 action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the State\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting statute violated due process. \nThe Eighth Circuit held that Johnson had standing under circumstances that \nare all but identical to those here. After recognizing the defendant\u2019s argument that \nstanding was not specifically addressed in either Osborne or Skinner, the Eighth \nCircuit stated: \u201c[A]ny lingering doubt about a prisoner\u2019s standing to bring the distinct \nprocedural due process claim recognized by those two cases was dispelled by the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Reed v. Goertz.\u201d Johnson, 69 F.4th at 511. The \nEighth Circuit held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s injury is redressable because, as explained in \nReed, \u2018if a federal court concludes [Arkansas\u2019s] post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate\u2019 the Prosecuting \nAttorney\u2019s \u2018justification for denying DNA testing.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority\u2019s reasoning, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nfinding of standing was unaffected by the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s prior holding in \nJohnson\u2019s motion for DNA testing that Arkansas\u2019s statute allows DNA testing only if \nit will \u201csignificantly advance\u201d the prisoner\u2019s claim of innocence, and that \u201cnone of the \nevidence that might result from the proposed testing could advance Johnson\u2019s claim \n\n \n13 \n \nof actual innocence.\u201d Id. at 508 (quoting state court decision). The Eighth Circuit, like \nJudge Higginson, simply followed Reed and applied it to the legal posture of the case. \nB. \nThe Ninth Circuit \nThe ruling below also contravenes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of Reed. In \nRedd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), Redd filed a \u00a7 1983 action against \njudges in the state court system, alleging that California\u2019s system of appointing \ncounsel violated his due process rights. \u201c[T]he State Officers contended that Redd \nlacks standing because his injury is not redressable by a decision in its favor.\u201d Id. at \n884. The Ninth Circuit concluded: \u201cOnce a court issues a declaratory judgment, that \norder effectuates a change in the legal status between the parties such that \u2018the \npractical consequences of that change would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the plaintiff \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Reed, 598 U.S. at 234 (additional internal quotations omitted)).  \nThe Ninth Circuit did not stop there:   \nIn Reed, for example, a Texas prisoner filed a section 1983 action \nclaiming the state\u2019s postconviction DNA procedures violated procedural \ndue process. . . . The \u201conly relief\u201d sought was \u201ca declaration that the \n[state court\u2019s] interpretation and application of state law was \nunconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment \nagainst the state prosecutor would redress that state\u2019s denial of DNA \ntesting. The declaration sought \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing\u201d and make it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d \nthat the state prosecutor would abide by the court\u2019s decision. \n \nId. (quoting Reed, 598 at 234) (additional internal quotations omitted). The Ninth \nCircuit thus did not undertake an individualized standing analysis to predict whether \nthe state defendants would actually give Redd the relief he sought if he prevailed in \nfederal court. The court instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was \n\n \n14 \n \nsimilarly situated to Reed\u2014exactly as the Eighth Circuit did in Johnson and as Judge \nHigginson did in his dissent here. \nII. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION CONTRADICTS THIS COURT\u2019S \nDECISION IN REED. \nBoth Ruben Gutierrez and Rodney Reed sit on death row in Texas. Both men \npetitioned their respective Texas district courts for post-conviction DNA testing \npursuant to Chapter 64, and both men were denied testing. Both men appealed to the \nCCA, and the CCA affirmed in both cases. The CCA told both men that, even if they \ngot the DNA testing they wanted, they would still ultimately be unable to obtain the \nrelief they sought. See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); \nA79. \nBoth men filed \u00a7 1983 lawsuits in federal district court seeking declaratory \njudgments that Texas\u2019s Chapter 64 violates their due process rights. Reed argued \nthat Chapter 64 violates his due process rights because the chain-of-custody \nrequirements were too demanding. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 violates his due \nprocess rights because he could not move for testing to show he was innocent of the \ndeath penalty, despite a clear right to file a subsequent habeas petition on that \nground under Texas Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3). Both men named the local District \nAttorneys as defendants. Both District Attorneys opposed DNA testing and continue \nto oppose DNA testing.  \nBoth men were found by the district courts to have Article III standing. \nGutierrez prevailed in district court and obtained a declaratory judgment in his favor. \nA42. The district court in Reed\u2019s case dismissed his \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\n \n15 \n \nfor failing to establish Chapter 64 violated due process. Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-\n0794-LY, 2019 WL 12073901, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). The losing parties in \nboth cases appealed to the Fifth Circuit.  \nHere, the men\u2019s paths diverged. The Fifth Circuit did not question that Reed \nhad standing to bring his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit but found the action untimely. Reed v. \nGoertz, 995 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2021). On certiorari review, this Court rejected Texas\u2019s \nargument that Reed lacked standing and instead ruled that a favorable federal \njudgment \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting\u201d and create a substantial likelihood of compliance by the State. Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234. This Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s timeliness ruling and remanded \nfor further proceedings. Id. at 237.  \nIn Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit grafted onto \nReed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the opposite result. The \nmajority scoured the state court record, including briefing by the parties, and \nspeculated that, in this case, state officials would not permit DNA testing even in the \nface of a federal court judgment because, in earlier proceedings, the CCA commented \nthat favorable DNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the \nredressability prong of Article III standing.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well beyond the analysis this Court \nestablished in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not \nmention examining the state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the \n\n \n16 \n \nprosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3. The majority justified its departure from \nReed based on the principle that \u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having \nbeen so decided.\u201d Id. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). The majority opined, in \nother words, that this Court did not parse the state court record in Reed because that \nrecord simply escaped this Court\u2019s attention.  \n\u201cThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly rooted in American \nconstitutional law.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at *6. To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered an injury in fact, (ii) the injury \nlikely was caused by the defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be redressed by \nthe requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 \n(1992). This Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he second and third standing \nrequirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often flip sides of the same coin. If \nthe defendant\u2019s actions cause an injury, enjoining that action or awarding damages \nfor the action will typically redress that injury.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL \n2964140, at *6 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThis Court applied that clear connection between causation and redressability \nin its analysis of Reed\u2019s standing in challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-\nconviction DNA statute. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, straightforwardly \nexplained: \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nrequested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, \n\n \n17 \n \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a \nfederal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the \nstate prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying testing. It is substantially \nlikely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234 (quotation omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe practical \nconsequences of that change [in law] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. \n(quotation omitted). Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s analysis of Reed\u2019s standing was clear, \ndirect, and easy to apply.  \nThis Court has advised that when courts have unanswered questions about \nstanding, they should look to similarly situated defendants for guidance: \u201cThe \n\u2018absence of precise definitions\u2019 has not left courts entirely at sea in applying the law \nof standing. Like \u2018most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable \ndefinition from developing case law.\u2019\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at \n*8 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). \u201cIn \u2018many cases the standing \nquestion can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u2013\n52). \nThe dissent below recognized that Gutierrez\u2019s case was in virtually the same \nposition as Reed. A16. The dissent\u2019s analysis was simple and followed this Court\u2019s \ndirective that, when it comes to standing, similarly situated litigants should be \ntreated the same. \n\n \n18 \n \nIn contrast, the panel majority did not look at the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s \ncomplaint and compare them to the allegations in Reed\u2019s complaint, despite both \nparties having filed 28(j) letters with the Fifth Circuit to address the impact of Reed \nhere. If it had, the majority would have seen that the allegation in Gutierrez\u2014that \nChapter 64 violates due process\u2014was identical to the allegation in Reed. Moreover, \nthe defendants in both cases were equivalent state officials, and the requested relief \nwas identical. The majority nonetheless failed to follow this Court\u2019s clear directive to \nanswer the standing question \u201cchiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u201d Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u201352. The \nmajority instead dispensed with the principle that standing applies equally to \nsimilarly situated parties and replaced it with a burdensome requirement that will \nhereupon individualize a plaintiff\u2019s standing. Under the majority\u2019s approach, \nstanding will now depend on how particular state officials\u2014or any federal \ndefendants\u2014may act in the future following a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  \nWhat is especially egregious about the Fifth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \nReed, however, is that the court\u2019s premise that Reed\u2019s posture in the CCA was \ndifferent than Gutierrez\u2019s posture is glaringly wrong. The panel majority postulated \nthat, \u201c[i]f Reed is to be distinguished from this case, we need to determine if the Court \nof Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations violated federal law, \nthat Reed\u2019s claim would fail.\u201d A13. The majority then concluded that the CCA had \nbeen silent on this question and distinguished Reed on the ground that \u201c[t]he Texas \n\n \n19 \n \ncourt made no holding in Reed comparable to its holding in Gutierrez.\u201d A13\u2013A14 n. 4. \nThe majority erred because its chosen distinction contradicts the events of Reed.  \nIn order to obtain DNA testing, Reed, like Gutierrez here, would still need to \nsatisfy all the requirements of Chapter 64, including that \u201cthe request for the \nproposed DNA testing is not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or \nadministration of justice.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(2)(B). The trial \ncourt found that Reed did not meet this requirement for seven distinct reasons. See \nReed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). On appeal, the CCA \naffirmed, \u201chold[ing] that Reed failed to establish that his request is not made to \nunreasonably delay the execution of his sentence or the administration of justice.\u201d Id. \nat 778. The CCA\u2019s analysis of why Reed cannot get relief because he cannot satisfy \n\u00a7 64.03(a)(2)(B) spans three pages\u2014far beyond the two sentences of dicta in the CCA\u2019s \nGutierrez opinions that the Fifth Circuit relied on here. The CCA thus squarely held \nthat Reed cannot obtain DNA testing for reasons that have nothing to do with the \nDNA statute\u2019s chain-of-custody limitations that Reed challenged in federal court. \nThis Court nonetheless held that Reed had standing because his complaints about \nChapter 64 were potentially redressable. The record in Reed thus refutes the \nmajority\u2019s attempt to distinguish it from this case.   \n \nThe Fifth Circuit may not disregard this Court\u2019s determinations and legal \nprecedents to strain for a result that it prefers. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-\nCruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a lower \ncourt in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it \n\n \n20 \n \nis essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court \ndecisions.\u201d); Winslow v. FERC, 587 F.3d 1133, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(\u201cVertical stare decisis\u2014both in letter and in spirit\u2014is a critical aspect of our \nhierarchical Judiciary headed by \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Const. art. III \n\u00a7 1)).  \nReversal of the Fifth Circuit is necessary to ensure adherence to this Court\u2019s \nconstitutional holdings, consistent application of a bedrock legal standard, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. See, e.g., James v. City of Boise, 577 U.S. 406, 307 (2016) \n(granting summary reversal and emphasizing that lower courts are \u201cbound by this \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Federal law\u201d); Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.S. 385, 395 (2016) (per \ncuriam) (noting that this Court \u201chas not shied away from deciding fact-intensive cases \nwhere, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law\u201d); Marmet \nHealth Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532 (2012) (per curiam) (granting \nsummary reversal where lower court\u2019s interpretation of federal law \u201cwas both \nincorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court\u201d). In \ncreating a novel requirement that conflicts with Reed, the Fifth Circuit majority has \nignored established Supreme Court precedent and created a circuit split where none \nshould exist. This Court should grant certiorari. \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant the writ of certiorari \nand stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in that court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n \nDated:  June 25, 2024",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigat\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigation in another case raising spiritual-advisor claims similar \nto Gutierrez\u2019s. Order Vacating Order, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt. Cameron Cnty., Sept. 21, 2015); see Ramirez v. Collier, No. 21-5592, 2021 WL \n4129220, at *1 (Sept. 10, 2021). \n\n10 \n \nthe absence in Chapter 64 of a provision for punishment-related DNA testing.5 \nMem. & Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, \n2021), ECF No. 141. The district court later entered a partial final judgment \nas to Gutierrez\u2019s DNA claims, which dismissed or denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s \nchallenges to Chapter 64 other than the one as to which the court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment. Order 4, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. \nDec. 8, 2021), ECF No. 188. Respondents appealed the district court\u2019s \ndeclaratory judgment.  \nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit held Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the \ndeclaratory judgment the district court granted. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 \nF.4th at 275. The Fifth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and \nremanded the case for the complaint to be dismissed. Id. The Fifth Circuit \ndenied Gutierrez\u2019s petition for rehearing and his motion to stay issuance of \nmandate.6 Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al, No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. June 7, \n2024), ECF No. 148-2; On Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. May 29, 2024), ECF No. 138-\n \n5  \nRespondents appealed the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, but the appeal \nwas dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70002 \n(5th Cir. June 24, 2021). \n \n6  \nThe district court has since dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s complaint. Order, Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133. He obtained a stay of his \nfederal habeas proceedings while he litigated his first request for postconviction DNA \ntesting and a subsequent state habeas application. Order, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019. See Mot. to Withdraw and for Appointment \nof Sub. Counsel 4, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018); \nComplaint, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2019). And \nhe repeatedly sought to delay the district court\u2019s resolution of his civil rights lawsuit. \nOrder, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 7, 2020) (order \nstaying proceedings pending TCCA\u2019s resolution of Gutierrez\u2019s second Chapter 64 \nappeal); Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex.

Dec. 6, 2021). \n\n17 \n \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3), \nillusory, and it accordingly granted Gutierrez a declaratory judgment. Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

Formalizing and evaluating this step provides strong evidence for a robust legal reasoning methodology.\n\nOverall, this is a high-value action that transitions from data collection to focused analysis, which is essential for both solving the current task and refining the agent's long-term strategy.",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024 WL 2964140 (U.S. June 13, 2024), and \nReed, 598 U.S. 230.  \nI. \nTHE DECISION BELOW CREATES A CIRCUIT SPLIT BY \nREOPENING A QUESTON THAT THIS COURT SOUGHT TO \nSETTLE IN REED. \nCertiorari review is crucial when courts of appeals disagree about an area of \nfederal law. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a); see also Reed, 598 U.S.at 234 (certiorari granted to \nresolve circuit split regarding \u201cwhen the statute of limitations begins to run for a \n\u00a7 1983 suit regarding a State\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures\u201d). The need to \nresolve the circuit split in this case is particularly important because this Court had \nalready settled the precise standing issue before the Fifth Circuit, yet the Fifth \nCircuit opinion conflicts with that holding and creates an awkward new rule for \nstanding, requiring a pre-jurisdictional mini-trial to forecast the conduct of state \nofficials in response to a not-yet-issued declaratory judgment. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).  \nThe Fifth Circuit panel majority\u2019s rewriting of this Court\u2019s clearly established \nlaw should be addressed before additional circuit courts of appeals are faced with \ncases brought by plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions seeking declaratory judgments, and cases \nlooking to apply Reed\u2019s standing analysis generally.  \n\n \n12 \n \nA. \nThe Eighth Circuit \nThe majority\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 \n(8th Cir. 2023). Johnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in \nthe context of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional because it violates due process. Johnson, like Reed and Gutierrez, is \non death row, and sued the prosecuting attorney in his Arkansas county pursuant to \na \u00a7 1983 action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the State\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting statute violated due process. \nThe Eighth Circuit held that Johnson had standing under circumstances that \nare all but identical to those here. After recognizing the defendant\u2019s argument that \nstanding was not specifically addressed in either Osborne or Skinner, the Eighth \nCircuit stated: \u201c[A]ny lingering doubt about a prisoner\u2019s standing to bring the distinct \nprocedural due process claim recognized by those two cases was dispelled by the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Reed v. Goertz.\u201d Johnson, 69 F.4th at 511. The \nEighth Circuit held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s injury is redressable because, as explained in \nReed, \u2018if a federal court concludes [Arkansas\u2019s] post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate\u2019 the Prosecuting \nAttorney\u2019s \u2018justification for denying DNA testing.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority\u2019s reasoning, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nfinding of standing was unaffected by the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s prior holding in \nJohnson\u2019s motion for DNA testing that Arkansas\u2019s statute allows DNA testing only if \nit will \u201csignificantly advance\u201d the prisoner\u2019s claim of innocence, and that \u201cnone of the \nevidence that might result from the proposed testing could advance Johnson\u2019s claim \n\n \n13 \n \nof actual innocence.\u201d Id. at 508 (quoting state court decision). The Eighth Circuit, like \nJudge Higginson, simply followed Reed and applied it to the legal posture of the case. \nB. \nThe Ninth Circuit \nThe ruling below also contravenes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of Reed. In \nRedd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), Redd filed a \u00a7 1983 action against \njudges in the state court system, alleging that California\u2019s system of appointing \ncounsel violated his due process rights. \u201c[T]he State Officers contended that Redd \nlacks standing because his injury is not redressable by a decision in its favor.\u201d Id. at \n884. The Ninth Circuit concluded: \u201cOnce a court issues a declaratory judgment, that \norder effectuates a change in the legal status between the parties such that \u2018the \npractical consequences of that change would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the plaintiff \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Reed, 598 U.S. at 234 (additional internal quotations omitted)).  \nThe Ninth Circuit did not stop there:   \nIn Reed, for example, a Texas prisoner filed a section 1983 action \nclaiming the state\u2019s postconviction DNA procedures violated procedural \ndue process. . . . The \u201conly relief\u201d sought was \u201ca declaration that the \n[state court\u2019s] interpretation and application of state law was \nunconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment \nagainst the state prosecutor would redress that state\u2019s denial of DNA \ntesting. The declaration sought \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing\u201d and make it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d \nthat the state prosecutor would abide by the court\u2019s decision. \n \nId. (quoting Reed, 598 at 234) (additional internal quotations omitted). The Ninth \nCircuit thus did not undertake an individualized standing analysis to predict whether \nthe state defendants would actually give Redd the relief he sought if he prevailed in \nfederal court. The court instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was \n\n \n14 \n \nsimilarly situated to Reed\u2014exactly as the Eighth Circuit did in Johnson and as Judge \nHigginson did in his dissent here. \nII. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION CONTRADICTS THIS COURT\u2019S \nDECISION IN REED. \nBoth Ruben Gutierrez and Rodney Reed sit on death row in Texas. Both men \npetitioned their respective Texas district courts for post-conviction DNA testing \npursuant to Chapter 64, and both men were denied testing. Both men appealed to the \nCCA, and the CCA affirmed in both cases. The CCA told both men that, even if they \ngot the DNA testing they wanted, they would still ultimately be unable to obtain the \nrelief they sought. See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); \nA79. \nBoth men filed \u00a7 1983 lawsuits in federal district court seeking declaratory \njudgments that Texas\u2019s Chapter 64 violates their due process rights. Reed argued \nthat Chapter 64 violates his due process rights because the chain-of-custody \nrequirements were too demanding. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 violates his due \nprocess rights because he could not move for testing to show he was innocent of the \ndeath penalty, despite a clear right to file a subsequent habeas petition on that \nground under Texas Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3). Both men named the local District \nAttorneys as defendants. Both District Attorneys opposed DNA testing and continue \nto oppose DNA testing.  \nBoth men were found by the district courts to have Article III standing. \nGutierrez prevailed in district court and obtained a declaratory judgment in his favor. \nA42. The district court in Reed\u2019s case dismissed his \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\n \n15 \n \nfor failing to establish Chapter 64 violated due process. Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-\n0794-LY, 2019 WL 12073901, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). The losing parties in \nboth cases appealed to the Fifth Circuit.  \nHere, the men\u2019s paths diverged. The Fifth Circuit did not question that Reed \nhad standing to bring his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit but found the action untimely. Reed v. \nGoertz, 995 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2021). On certiorari review, this Court rejected Texas\u2019s \nargument that Reed lacked standing and instead ruled that a favorable federal \njudgment \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting\u201d and create a substantial likelihood of compliance by the State. Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234. This Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s timeliness ruling and remanded \nfor further proceedings. Id. at 237.  \nIn Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit grafted onto \nReed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the opposite result. The \nmajority scoured the state court record, including briefing by the parties, and \nspeculated that, in this case, state officials would not permit DNA testing even in the \nface of a federal court judgment because, in earlier proceedings, the CCA commented \nthat favorable DNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the \nredressability prong of Article III standing.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well beyond the analysis this Court \nestablished in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not \nmention examining the state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the \n\n \n16 \n \nprosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3. The majority justified its departure from \nReed based on the principle that \u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having \nbeen so decided.\u201d Id. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). The majority opined, in \nother words, that this Court did not parse the state court record in Reed because that \nrecord simply escaped this Court\u2019s attention.  \n\u201cThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly rooted in American \nconstitutional law.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at *6. To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered an injury in fact, (ii) the injury \nlikely was caused by the defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be redressed by \nthe requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 \n(1992). This Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he second and third standing \nrequirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often flip sides of the same coin. If \nthe defendant\u2019s actions cause an injury, enjoining that action or awarding damages \nfor the action will typically redress that injury.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL \n2964140, at *6 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThis Court applied that clear connection between causation and redressability \nin its analysis of Reed\u2019s standing in challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-\nconviction DNA statute. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, straightforwardly \nexplained: \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nrequested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, \n\n \n17 \n \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a \nfederal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the \nstate prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying testing. It is substantially \nlikely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234 (quotation omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe practical \nconsequences of that change [in law] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. \n(quotation omitted). Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s analysis of Reed\u2019s standing was clear, \ndirect, and easy to apply.  \nThis Court has advised that when courts have unanswered questions about \nstanding, they should look to similarly situated defendants for guidance: \u201cThe \n\u2018absence of precise definitions\u2019 has not left courts entirely at sea in applying the law \nof standing. Like \u2018most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable \ndefinition from developing case law.\u2019\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at \n*8 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). \u201cIn \u2018many cases the standing \nquestion can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u2013\n52). \nThe dissent below recognized that Gutierrez\u2019s case was in virtually the same \nposition as Reed. A16. The dissent\u2019s analysis was simple and followed this Court\u2019s \ndirective that, when it comes to standing, similarly situated litigants should be \ntreated the same. \n\n \n18 \n \nIn contrast, the panel majority did not look at the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s \ncomplaint and compare them to the allegations in Reed\u2019s complaint, despite both \nparties having filed 28(j) letters with the Fifth Circuit to address the impact of Reed \nhere. If it had, the majority would have seen that the allegation in Gutierrez\u2014that \nChapter 64 violates due process\u2014was identical to the allegation in Reed. Moreover, \nthe defendants in both cases were equivalent state officials, and the requested relief \nwas identical. The majority nonetheless failed to follow this Court\u2019s clear directive to \nanswer the standing question \u201cchiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u201d Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u201352. The \nmajority instead dispensed with the principle that standing applies equally to \nsimilarly situated parties and replaced it with a burdensome requirement that will \nhereupon individualize a plaintiff\u2019s standing. Under the majority\u2019s approach, \nstanding will now depend on how particular state officials\u2014or any federal \ndefendants\u2014may act in the future following a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  \nWhat is especially egregious about the Fifth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \nReed, however, is that the court\u2019s premise that Reed\u2019s posture in the CCA was \ndifferent than Gutierrez\u2019s posture is glaringly wrong. The panel majority postulated \nthat, \u201c[i]f Reed is to be distinguished from this case, we need to determine if the Court \nof Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations violated federal law, \nthat Reed\u2019s claim would fail.\u201d A13. The majority then concluded that the CCA had \nbeen silent on this question and distinguished Reed on the ground that \u201c[t]he Texas \n\n \n19 \n \ncourt made no holding in Reed comparable to its holding in Gutierrez.\u201d A13\u2013A14 n. 4. \nThe majority erred because its chosen distinction contradicts the events of Reed.  \nIn order to obtain DNA testing, Reed, like Gutierrez here, would still need to \nsatisfy all the requirements of Chapter 64, including that \u201cthe request for the \nproposed DNA testing is not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or \nadministration of justice.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(2)(B). The trial \ncourt found that Reed did not meet this requirement for seven distinct reasons. See \nReed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). On appeal, the CCA \naffirmed, \u201chold[ing] that Reed failed to establish that his request is not made to \nunreasonably delay the execution of his sentence or the administration of justice.\u201d Id. \nat 778. The CCA\u2019s analysis of why Reed cannot get relief because he cannot satisfy \n\u00a7 64.03(a)(2)(B) spans three pages\u2014far beyond the two sentences of dicta in the CCA\u2019s \nGutierrez opinions that the Fifth Circuit relied on here. The CCA thus squarely held \nthat Reed cannot obtain DNA testing for reasons that have nothing to do with the \nDNA statute\u2019s chain-of-custody limitations that Reed challenged in federal court. \nThis Court nonetheless held that Reed had standing because his complaints about \nChapter 64 were potentially redressable. The record in Reed thus refutes the \nmajority\u2019s attempt to distinguish it from this case.   \n \nThe Fifth Circuit may not disregard this Court\u2019s determinations and legal \nprecedents to strain for a result that it prefers. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-\nCruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a lower \ncourt in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it \n\n \n20 \n \nis essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court \ndecisions.\u201d); Winslow v. FERC, 587 F.3d 1133, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(\u201cVertical stare decisis\u2014both in letter and in spirit\u2014is a critical aspect of our \nhierarchical Judiciary headed by \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Const. art. III \n\u00a7 1)).  \nReversal of the Fifth Circuit is necessary to ensure adherence to this Court\u2019s \nconstitutional holdings, consistent application of a bedrock legal standard, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. See, e.g., James v. City of Boise, 577 U.S. 406, 307 (2016) \n(granting summary reversal and emphasizing that lower courts are \u201cbound by this \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Federal law\u201d); Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.S. 385, 395 (2016) (per \ncuriam) (noting that this Court \u201chas not shied away from deciding fact-intensive cases \nwhere, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law\u201d); Marmet \nHealth Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532 (2012) (per curiam) (granting \nsummary reversal where lower court\u2019s interpretation of federal law \u201cwas both \nincorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court\u201d). In \ncreating a novel requirement that conflicts with Reed, the Fifth Circuit majority has \nignored established Supreme Court precedent and created a circuit split where none \nshould exist. This Court should grant certiorari. \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant the writ of certiorari \nand stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in that court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n \nDated:  June 25, 2024",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigat\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex.

The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.

Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019.

Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court\n\n",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigat\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56.

June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133. He obtained a stay of his \nfederal habeas proceedings while he litigated his first request for postconviction DNA \ntesting and a subsequent state habeas application. Order, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019. See Mot. to Withdraw and for Appointment \nof Sub. Counsel 4, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018); \nComplaint, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex.

Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

Bradley, Clerk\nRUBEN GUTIERREZ,\nPetitioner,\nvs.\nLORIE DAVIS,\nRespondent.\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nCIVIL NO. 1:09-CV-00022\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nORDER\nBefore the Court are Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez's (\"Gutierrez\") July 24,\n2018, Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of Substitute Counsel filed\nby\nappointed\ncounsel\nMargaret\nSchmucker\n(\"Schmucker\"),\nDkt.\nNo.\n56;\nRespondent's July 27, 2018, response to the motion, Dkt. No. 58; and Gutierrez's\nAugust\n3,\n2018, reply to the response,\nDkt.\nNo.\n62.\nThe\nCourt GRANTS\nSchmucker's motion to withdraw and APPOINTS Attorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill,\n(\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. The Court further (1) ORDERS Gutierrez to\nrequest the appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation no\nlater than August 10, 2018, should he intend to request such appointment; and (2)\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nI.\nBackground\nOn\nSeptember\n15,\n2008, the\nCourt appointed\nSchmucker to represent\nGutierrez in his federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to\n18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599.\nGutierrez v. Quarterman, l:08-mc-008, Dkt. No. 5. The Court denied Gutierrez's\npetition on October 3, 2013. Dkt. No. 44. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on November\n13, 2014, Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App'x 371 (5th Cir. 2014), and the United\nStates Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari review, Gutierrez v. Stephens,\n_ U.S._, 136 S. Ct. 35 (2015). The State of Texas has set Gutierrez's execution\nfor September 12, 2018.\n1 / 6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 6\nSchmucker has moved to substitute counsel with only weeks remammg\nbefore the execution date. See Dkt. No. 56. On July 27, 2018, the Court ordered\nPetitioner to file a certificate of consent signed by Gutierrez or provide another\nindication that Gutierrez has been informed of, and consents to, a change in\nrepresentation. Dkt. No. 59. The record suggests that Gutierrez consents to a\nchange in representation. See Dkt. No. 62 at 1-2. The motion to substitute counsel\nis\nbased\non\nSchmucker's\nability to\nprovide\ncompetent representation\nbefore\nGutierrez's execution. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. The motion argues that Schmucker lacks\nthe experience necessary to litigate effectively the challenges Gutierrez anticipates\nraising in the\nshort time before his execution date. Id.\nThe motion further\nrepresents that,\neven\nif Schmucker\ncould provide adequate\nlegal assistance,\nSchmucker can no longer practice in the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel. Id. at 5\n(citing In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15, 2017)). The motion proposes\nappointing the Capital Habeas Unit ('CHU\") from the Federal Defender's Office in\nthe Western District of Texas. Id. at 5-6. The motion represents that the CHU\ncurrently lacks the resources to provide adequate representation to Gutierrez, but\nwould try to find new counsel to do so. Id. at 6.\nRespondent opposes the substitution of counsel. Dkt. No. 58. Respondent\nargues that Gutierrez unjustifiably delayed filing his motion until a stay of the\nexecution date would be inevitable. Id. at 36. Respondent also argues that\nSchmucker is sufficiently experienced to draft any future pleadings and that any\nlast-minute litigation would lack merit. Id. at 6-10. Recognizing that Schmucker\ncan no longer appear before the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel, Respondent\nasserts that she can still \"practic[e] in the Fifth Circuit as non-[Criminal Justice\nAct] counsel.\" Id. at 10.\nSchmucker filed a reply to Respondent's opposition. Dkt. No. 62. Schmucker\ndoes\nnot\nprovide\nany\ncertificate\nof\nconsent\nindicating\nGutierrez's assent to\nsubstitution, but she affirms that she discussed the need for additional counsel with\nGutierrez\non July\n13,\n2018,\nand that both\nGutierrez\nand\nSchmucker have\n\"attempted to find qualified counsel\" since that time. Id. at\n1-2. Schmucker\n2/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 6\nrepresents that\nshe has\n\"made\nmultiple attempts to\ncommunicate\nwith Mr.\nGutierrez by phone and express mail in order to discuss the matter\n[of her\nwithdrawal and substitution following the Court's July 27, 2018, Order] and obtain\nclarity as to [Gutierrez's] wishes.\" Id. at 2-3. However, Schmucker represents that\nshe \"has been unsuccessful in [her] attempts [at communication with Gutierrez] but\nwill advise the Court if and when [she successfully communicates with her client].\"\nId. at 3. Schmucker responds that she has not delayed in bringing the instant\nmatter to the Court's attention, but other commitments have consumed her time.\nId. at 5-7. Schmucker argues that her disqualification in the Fifth Circuit does not\nimpinge on her qualifications, only her practical ability to litigate in that court. Id.\nat 4-5.\nEven so, Schmucker expresses concern that she lacks sufficient experience\nto litigate a last-minute complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983 that she has\ndrafted, but not filed, on Gutierrez's behalf. Id. at 4-5. Schmucker argues that\nappointment of co-counsel who \"is more familiar with\u00a7 1983 suits and who is on the\nFifth Circuit's [Criminal Justice Act] panel would largely ameliorate the concerns\nunderlying the pending motion to withdraw.\" Id. at 4.\nThe Court considers Parties' filings.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a court should substitute an\nattorney when necessary in the \"interests of justice.\" Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648,\n663\n(2012). This \"peculiarly context-specific inquiry\" involves \"several relevant\nconsiderations,\" including: \"the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district\ncourt's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and the asserted cause for that\ncomplaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\nbetween lawyer and client (and the client's own responsibility, if any, for that\nconflict).\"\nId.; see also Mendoza v. Stephens, 783 F.3d 203, 208 (5th Cir. 2015)\n(relying on the Martel considerations).\nFederal law guarantees that an inmate facing a death sentence will have the\nprotection afforded by appointed counsel. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599. Once a court\nappoints an attorney under \u00a7 3599, that attorney \"shall represent the defendant\n3/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 6\nthroughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\" unless that\nattorney is \"replaced by similarly qualified counsel.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e) (emphasis\nadded).\nSchmucker's\nappointment\ncreated an\nobligation\nfor her to represent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\n\"all\navailable\npost-conviction\nprocess,\ntogether\nwith\napplications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\"\nas\nwell\nas\n\"competency\nproceedings\nand proceedings\nfor\nexecutive\nor\nother\nclemency.\" Id.; see also Wilkins v. Davis, 832 F.3d 547, 557 (5th Cir. 2016).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nWhen Schmucker applied to join the Criminal Justice Act panel and accepted\nclients in death penalty-related matters, including this one, she explicitly and\nimplicitly represented that she has the qualifications and experience necessary to\nlitigate this case. The present circumstances, however, prevent Schmucker from\nfulfilling her obligations to her client.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Fifth Circuit entered an order \"disqualifying\n[Schmucker] from performing work pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act ... in\ncases before\n[that]\ncourt as a result of a pattern of rude and unprofessional\ncommunications with court staff.\" In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15,\n2017). It was incumbent on Schmucker to inform this Court of that discipline, but\nshe did not do so. See Rule 9, Rules of Discipline, United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas, Local Rules (\"A lawyer disciplined by another court\nin the United States shall promptly notify this court in writing and furnish to the\nclerk\nof the\ncourt\na\ncertified\ncopy\nof the\norder\nof discipline.\").\nOnly now,\napproximately seven months after her discipline and with little time remammg\nbefore execution, has Schmucker advised the Court of her discipline.\nThe pleadings suggest that Schmucker has made some efforts to prepare for\nGutierrez's execution, but has not filed any pleadings despite quickly approaching\ndue dates for matters such as filing a clemency petition. The motion to substitute\nrepresents that potential remedies which may exist for Gutierrez include a civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. Litigation of such an\naction, and other possible litigation strategies such as a stay of execution or\n4/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 5 of 6\nsuccessive federal petition, would require an attorney who can represent Gutierrez\nin the Fifth Circuit. Schmucker's continued representation of Gutierrez would\npreclude her client from availing himself of potential avenues of relief. Gutierrez\nwould effectively be left with \"no counsel at all\" for the purposes of any appeal.\nMartel, 132 S. Ct. at 1286; see also Christeson v. Roper,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 891,\n895 (2015) (finding that a conflict of interests left an inmate effectively without\ncounsel).1\nWhile \"the delay in seeking substitution ... might be [a] valid consideration[]\n[weighing against substitution of counsel] in many cases,\" Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at\n895, the fact that Schmucker's continued representation would leave Gutierrez\nwithout access to an appellate attorney weighs heavily in favor of granting the\nmotion to substitute.\nGutierrez bears no responsibility for the fact that his\nappointed counsel can no longer practice before the Fifth Circuit.\nWith Gutierrez's execution fast approaching, the Court FINDS that the\ninterests\nof justice require the\nsubstitution of counsel.\nThe\nCourt, therefore,\nGRANTS Gutierrez's\nmotion to withdraw and ORDERS the\nsubstitution\nof\ncounsel. Dkt. No. 56.\nThe motion to substitute represents that Schmucker has attempted to secure\nassistance in representing Gutierrez. Id. at 5-6. While this matter should have been\nbrought to the Court's attention long before, the Court has expeditiously found\nqualified and competent counsel willing to represent Gutierrez. The Court hereby\nAPPOINTS the following attorney to represent Gutierrez:\nRichard W. Rogers, III\n710 Buffalo Street, Suite 202\nCorpus Christi, TX 78401\n361-888-7620\nFax: 361-888-7619\nEmail: rwrogersiii@aol.com\n1\nRespondent does not elaborate on how Schmucker could appear before the Fifth Circuit as \"non\u00ad\n[Criminal Justice Act] counsel,\" Dkt. No. 58 at 10, and does not provide any law that would\nauthorize her to appear forthwith on a pro bono basis.\n5/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 6 of 6\nRogers will be\ncompensated at the maximum rate pursuant to\n18 U.S.C\n}\n3599(g)(l). Rogers may submit requests for interim payment for his work. Rogers\nwill\nrepresent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\nevery\nsubsequent\nstage\nof\navailable\nproceedings.\nUnder federal law, a capital inmate \"shall be entitled to the appointment of\none or more attorneys.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2). Should Gutierrez intend to request\nthe appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation, the Court\nORDERS him to make such a request no later than August 10, 2018.\nThe\nCourt notes that,\ngiven the\nshort timeline\nbefore the\nscheduled\nexecution, it is possible that the substitution of counsel may only be given effect by\na stay. This Court has the authority to grant a stay of execution. Battaglia v.\nStephens,\n824\nF.3d\n470,\n475\n(5th\nCir.\n2016).\nHowever,\nbecause\na\nprisoner\ncondemned to death has no automatic entitlement to a stay of execution, see\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 858 (1994), the Court will address the question of\na stay if and when it is fully briefed by the parties. To that end, the Court\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nIV.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Court:\n\u2022\nGRANTS Gutierrez's Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of\nSubstitute Counsel, Dkt. No. 56;\n\u2022\nAPPOINTS Rogers as substitute counsel;\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to request the appointment of an additional attorney to\naid in his representation no later than August 10, 2018, should he intend to\nrequest such appointment; and\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15,\n2018.\nSIGNED this 6th day ofAugust, 2018b~\nHilda Tagle\n~\nSenior United States District Judge\n6/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 1 of 4\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of Texas\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nBROWNSVILLE DIVISION\nENTERED\nAugust 14, 2018\nDavid J. Bradley, Clerk\nRUBEN GUTIERREZ,\nPetitioner,\nvs.\nLORIE DAVIS,\nRespondent.\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nCIVIL NO. 1:09-CV-00022\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nORDER\nBefore the Court are Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez's (\"Gutierrez\") August 10,\n2018, opposed Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 66; Respondent Lorie Davis'\n(\"Davis\") August 13, 2018, Opposition to Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 69;\nand Gutierrez's August 14, 2018, reply to the opposition, Dkt. No. 70.\nThe Court\nGRANTS Gutierrez's motion and CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal\nCommunity Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\"FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA'') as co-counsel in this case.\nI.\nBackground\nOn August 6, 2018, the Court granted Attorney Margaret Schmucker's\n(\"Schmucker\") motion to withdraw from representing Gutierrez and appointed\nAttorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill, (\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. Dkt. No. 63. The\nmotion to substitute counsel indicated that potential remedies which may exist for\nGutierrez include filing a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nRecognizing\nthat federal law entitles death-row inmates to the appointment of more than one\nattorney, the Court ordered Gutierrez to request the assistance of an additional\nattorney by August 10, 2018. Petitioner now seeks to the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA as Rogers' co-counsel. Dkt. No. 66.\nSuch appointment would be conditioned\non the FCDO-EDPA receiving approval to pursue out-of-district representation from\n(1) the Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, and (2) Fifth Circuit Chief Judge Carl E. Stewart. Id. at 4.\n1/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 4\nDavis opposes the appointment of co-counsel.\nDkt. No. 69. Respondent\nprovides four reasons for objecting to FCDO-EDPA serving as co-counsel:\n(1)\nRespondent objects to any delay that would result from the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA, id. at 2-3; (2) Respondent contends that no conflict of interest exists between\nGutierrez\nand\nRogers requiring the\nsubstitution\nof counsel,\nid.\nat\n3-4;\n(3)\nRespondent argues that appointed counsel does not have a statutory right to file a\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and thus additional attorneys for the preparation of\nthat lawsuit are not necessary, id. at 4-5; and (4) the interests of justice do not\nrequire the appointment of counsel to assist in a \u00a7 1983 case which is \"an extremely\nlimited proceeding,\" id. at 5.\nGutierrez filed a reply to Davis' opposition.\nDkt. No. 70.\nGutierrez replies\nthat any delay is not his fault, but that of Schmucker for failing to bring problems\nwith her representation before the Court in a timely manner. Id. at 1-2. Gutierrez\nargues that Davis relies on an incorrect standard when opposing the appointment of\nco-counsel. Id. at 2. Likewise, Gutierrez contends that Davis presents a constricted\nview of the responsibilities of co-counsel which will encompass more than assisting\nin a civil rights action. Id. at 3. Even under the standards propounded by Davis,\nhowever, Gutierrez argues that he has an entitlement to co-counsel under the law.\nId. at 1-4.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nFederal law entitles Gutierrez \"to the appointment of one or more attorneys .\n\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599a)(1); see also McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 (1994)\n(finding,\nunder\na\nformer\nstatute, that federal\nlaw\n\"grants\nindigent\ncapital\ndefendants a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel\").\nThe governing statute\ndoes not necessarily require the appointment of more than one attorney. After the\nappointment of one qualified attorney, \"the court, for good cause, may appoint\nanother attorney whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise\nenable him or her to properly represent the defendant, with due consideration to the\nseriousness of the possible penalty and to the unique and complex nature of the\nlitigation.\"\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(d) (emphasis added).\nHowever, the federal court's\n2/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 4\nGuide to Judiciary Policy contemplates that \"[d]ue to the complex, demanding,\nand protracted nature of death penalty proceedings, judicial officers should consider\nappointing at least two attorneys.\" Vol. 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy\u00a7 620.10. 20b)\n(emphasis added).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nRespondent asks the court to apply the interests-of-justice standard when\ndeciding whether to appoint co-counsel in this action. Dkt. 69 at 2-5; see Christeson\nv. Roper,\nU.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 891, 894 (2015) (applying interests-of-justice\nstandard to motions to substitute counsel); Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 663 (2012)\n(same).\nUnder statutory law, however, Gutierrez only needs to show \"good cause\"\nfor the appointment of another attorney.\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).\nFederal judicial\npolicy presumes that the complex nature of capital representation itself present\ngood cause for representation by at least two attorneys.\nRespondent also objects that the court should not appoint counsel because it\nappears that Gutierrez will soon litigate a civil rights action. Respondent contends\nthe filing of that lawsuit should not require the services of more than one attorney.\nThe appointment of co-counsel, however, is not limited to that one task. Once a\ncourt appoints an attorney under\n\u00a7\n3599, that attorney \"shall represent the\ndefendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings ....\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599(e).\nCo-counsel will have a responsibility to represent Gutierrez\nthroughout \"all available post-conviction process, together with applications for\nstays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\" as well as\n\"competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency.\"\nId.\nWhile the filing of a civil rights action is foreseeable, so are other possible avenues\nof relief such as a motion for a stay of execution, state clemency, and successive\nhabeas proceedings.\nRespondent's narrow view of appointment does not fully\ncapture the possible work co-counsel may perform.\nReviewing the pleadings and the law, and in consideration of the possible\nremedies available to Gutierrez, the Court finds that Gutierrez has shown good\ncause for the appointment of co-counsel.\n3/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 4\nIV.\nConclusion\nAccordingly, the Court \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

No. 58; and Gutierrez's\nAugust\n3,\n2018, reply to the response,\nDkt.\nNo.\n62.\nThe\nCourt GRANTS\nSchmucker's motion to withdraw and APPOINTS Attorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill,\n(\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. The Court further (1) ORDERS Gutierrez to\nrequest the appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation no\nlater than August 10, 2018, should he intend to request such appointment; and (2)\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nI.\nBackground\nOn\nSeptember\n15,\n2008, the\nCourt appointed\nSchmucker to represent\nGutierrez in his federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to\n18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599.\nGutierrez v. Quarterman, l:08-mc-008, Dkt. No. 5. The Court denied Gutierrez's\npetition on October 3, 2013. Dkt. No. 44. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on November\n13, 2014, Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App'x 371 (5th Cir. 2014), and the United\nStates Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari review, Gutierrez v. Stephens,\n_ U.S._, 136 S. Ct. 35 (2015). The State of Texas has set Gutierrez's execution\nfor September 12, 2018.\n1 / 6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 6\nSchmucker has moved to substitute counsel with only weeks remammg\nbefore the execution date. See Dkt. No. 56. On July 27, 2018, the Court ordered\nPetitioner to file a certificate of consent signed by Gutierrez or provide another\nindication that Gutierrez has been informed of, and consents to, a change in\nrepresentation. Dkt. No. 59. The record suggests that Gutierrez consents to a\nchange in representation. See Dkt. No. 62 at 1-2. The motion to substitute counsel\nis\nbased\non\nSchmucker's\nability to\nprovide\ncompetent representation\nbefore\nGutierrez's execution. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. The motion argues that Schmucker lacks\nthe experience necessary to litigate effectively the challenges Gutierrez anticipates\nraising in the\nshort time before his execution date. Id.\nThe motion further\nrepresents that,\neven\nif Schmucker\ncould provide adequate\nlegal assistance,\nSchmucker can no longer practice in the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel. Id. at 5\n(citing In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15, 2017)). The motion proposes\nappointing the Capital Habeas Unit ('CHU\") from the Federal Defender's Office in\nthe Western District of Texas. Id. at 5-6. The motion represents that the CHU\ncurrently lacks the resources to provide adequate representation to Gutierrez, but\nwould try to find new counsel to do so. Id. at 6.\nRespondent opposes the substitution of counsel. Dkt. No. 58. Respondent\nargues that Gutierrez unjustifiably delayed filing his motion until a stay of the\nexecution date would be inevitable. Id. at 36. Respondent also argues that\nSchmucker is sufficiently experienced to draft any future pleadings and that any\nlast-minute litigation would lack merit. Id. at 6-10. Recognizing that Schmucker\ncan no longer appear before the Fifth Circuit as appointed counsel, Respondent\nasserts that she can still \"practic[e] in the Fifth Circuit as non-[Criminal Justice\nAct] counsel.\" Id. at 10.\nSchmucker filed a reply to Respondent's opposition. Dkt. No. 62. Schmucker\ndoes\nnot\nprovide\nany\ncertificate\nof\nconsent\nindicating\nGutierrez's assent to\nsubstitution, but she affirms that she discussed the need for additional counsel with\nGutierrez\non July\n13,\n2018,\nand that both\nGutierrez\nand\nSchmucker have\n\"attempted to find qualified counsel\" since that time. Id. at\n1-2. Schmucker\n2/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 6\nrepresents that\nshe has\n\"made\nmultiple attempts to\ncommunicate\nwith Mr.\nGutierrez by phone and express mail in order to discuss the matter\n[of her\nwithdrawal and substitution following the Court's July 27, 2018, Order] and obtain\nclarity as to [Gutierrez's] wishes.\" Id. at 2-3. However, Schmucker represents that\nshe \"has been unsuccessful in [her] attempts [at communication with Gutierrez] but\nwill advise the Court if and when [she successfully communicates with her client].\"\nId. at 3. Schmucker responds that she has not delayed in bringing the instant\nmatter to the Court's attention, but other commitments have consumed her time.\nId. at 5-7. Schmucker argues that her disqualification in the Fifth Circuit does not\nimpinge on her qualifications, only her practical ability to litigate in that court. Id.\nat 4-5.\nEven so, Schmucker expresses concern that she lacks sufficient experience\nto litigate a last-minute complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983 that she has\ndrafted, but not filed, on Gutierrez's behalf. Id. at 4-5. Schmucker argues that\nappointment of co-counsel who \"is more familiar with\u00a7 1983 suits and who is on the\nFifth Circuit's [Criminal Justice Act] panel would largely ameliorate the concerns\nunderlying the pending motion to withdraw.\" Id. at 4.\nThe Court considers Parties' filings.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a court should substitute an\nattorney when necessary in the \"interests of justice.\" Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648,\n663\n(2012). This \"peculiarly context-specific inquiry\" involves \"several relevant\nconsiderations,\" including: \"the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district\ncourt's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and the asserted cause for that\ncomplaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\nbetween lawyer and client (and the client's own responsibility, if any, for that\nconflict).\"\nId.; see also Mendoza v. Stephens, 783 F.3d 203, 208 (5th Cir. 2015)\n(relying on the Martel considerations).\nFederal law guarantees that an inmate facing a death sentence will have the\nprotection afforded by appointed counsel. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3599. Once a court\nappoints an attorney under \u00a7 3599, that attorney \"shall represent the defendant\n3/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 6\nthroughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\" unless that\nattorney is \"replaced by similarly qualified counsel.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(e) (emphasis\nadded).\nSchmucker's\nappointment\ncreated an\nobligation\nfor her to represent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\n\"all\navailable\npost-conviction\nprocess,\ntogether\nwith\napplications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\"\nas\nwell\nas\n\"competency\nproceedings\nand proceedings\nfor\nexecutive\nor\nother\nclemency.\" Id.; see also Wilkins v. Davis, 832 F.3d 547, 557 (5th Cir. 2016).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nWhen Schmucker applied to join the Criminal Justice Act panel and accepted\nclients in death penalty-related matters, including this one, she explicitly and\nimplicitly represented that she has the qualifications and experience necessary to\nlitigate this case. The present circumstances, however, prevent Schmucker from\nfulfilling her obligations to her client.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Fifth Circuit entered an order \"disqualifying\n[Schmucker] from performing work pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act ... in\ncases before\n[that]\ncourt as a result of a pattern of rude and unprofessional\ncommunications with court staff.\" In re Schmucker, No. 17-98007 (5th Cir. Dec. 15,\n2017). It was incumbent on Schmucker to inform this Court of that discipline, but\nshe did not do so. See Rule 9, Rules of Discipline, United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas, Local Rules (\"A lawyer disciplined by another court\nin the United States shall promptly notify this court in writing and furnish to the\nclerk\nof the\ncourt\na\ncertified\ncopy\nof the\norder\nof discipline.\").\nOnly now,\napproximately seven months after her discipline and with little time remammg\nbefore execution, has Schmucker advised the Court of her discipline.\nThe pleadings suggest that Schmucker has made some efforts to prepare for\nGutierrez's execution, but has not filed any pleadings despite quickly approaching\ndue dates for matters such as filing a clemency petition. The motion to substitute\nrepresents that potential remedies which may exist for Gutierrez include a civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Dkt. No. 56 at 4-5. Litigation of such an\naction, and other possible litigation strategies such as a stay of execution or\n4/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 5 of 6\nsuccessive federal petition, would require an attorney who can represent Gutierrez\nin the Fifth Circuit. Schmucker's continued representation of Gutierrez would\npreclude her client from availing himself of potential avenues of relief. Gutierrez\nwould effectively be left with \"no counsel at all\" for the purposes of any appeal.\nMartel, 132 S. Ct. at 1286; see also Christeson v. Roper,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 891,\n895 (2015) (finding that a conflict of interests left an inmate effectively without\ncounsel).1\nWhile \"the delay in seeking substitution ... might be [a] valid consideration[]\n[weighing against substitution of counsel] in many cases,\" Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at\n895, the fact that Schmucker's continued representation would leave Gutierrez\nwithout access to an appellate attorney weighs heavily in favor of granting the\nmotion to substitute.\nGutierrez bears no responsibility for the fact that his\nappointed counsel can no longer practice before the Fifth Circuit.\nWith Gutierrez's execution fast approaching, the Court FINDS that the\ninterests\nof justice require the\nsubstitution of counsel.\nThe\nCourt, therefore,\nGRANTS Gutierrez's\nmotion to withdraw and ORDERS the\nsubstitution\nof\ncounsel. Dkt. No. 56.\nThe motion to substitute represents that Schmucker has attempted to secure\nassistance in representing Gutierrez. Id. at 5-6. While this matter should have been\nbrought to the Court's attention long before, the Court has expeditiously found\nqualified and competent counsel willing to represent Gutierrez. The Court hereby\nAPPOINTS the following attorney to represent Gutierrez:\nRichard W. Rogers, III\n710 Buffalo Street, Suite 202\nCorpus Christi, TX 78401\n361-888-7620\nFax: 361-888-7619\nEmail: rwrogersiii@aol.com\n1\nRespondent does not elaborate on how Schmucker could appear before the Fifth Circuit as \"non\u00ad\n[Criminal Justice Act] counsel,\" Dkt. No. 58 at 10, and does not provide any law that would\nauthorize her to appear forthwith on a pro bono basis.\n5/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 63\nFiled on 08/06/18 in TXSD\nPage 6 of 6\nRogers will be\ncompensated at the maximum rate pursuant to\n18 U.S.C\n}\n3599(g)(l). Rogers may submit requests for interim payment for his work. Rogers\nwill\nrepresent\nGutierrez\nthroughout\nevery\nsubsequent\nstage\nof\navailable\nproceedings.\nUnder federal law, a capital inmate \"shall be entitled to the appointment of\none or more attorneys.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(a)(2). Should Gutierrez intend to request\nthe appointment of an additional attorney to aid in his representation, the Court\nORDERS him to make such a request no later than August 10, 2018.\nThe\nCourt notes that,\ngiven the\nshort timeline\nbefore the\nscheduled\nexecution, it is possible that the substitution of counsel may only be given effect by\na stay. This Court has the authority to grant a stay of execution. Battaglia v.\nStephens,\n824\nF.3d\n470,\n475\n(5th\nCir.\n2016).\nHowever,\nbecause\na\nprisoner\ncondemned to death has no automatic entitlement to a stay of execution, see\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 858 (1994), the Court will address the question of\na stay if and when it is fully briefed by the parties. To that end, the Court\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15, 2018.\nIV.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Court:\n\u2022\nGRANTS Gutierrez's Opposed Motion to Withdraw and for Appointment of\nSubstitute Counsel, Dkt. No. 56;\n\u2022\nAPPOINTS Rogers as substitute counsel;\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to request the appointment of an additional attorney to\naid in his representation no later than August 10, 2018, should he intend to\nrequest such appointment; and\n\u2022\nORDERS Gutierrez to file any motion for a stay no later than August 15,\n2018.\nSIGNED this 6th day ofAugust, 2018b~\nHilda Tagle\n~\nSenior United States District Judge\n6/6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 1 of 4\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of Texas\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nBROWNSVILLE DIVISION\nENTERED\nAugust 14, 2018\nDavid J.

No. 66; Respondent Lorie Davis'\n(\"Davis\") August 13, 2018, Opposition to Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel, Dkt. No. 69;\nand Gutierrez's August 14, 2018, reply to the opposition, Dkt. No. 70.\nThe Court\nGRANTS Gutierrez's motion and CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal\nCommunity Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\"FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA'') as co-counsel in this case.\nI.\nBackground\nOn August 6, 2018, the Court granted Attorney Margaret Schmucker's\n(\"Schmucker\") motion to withdraw from representing Gutierrez and appointed\nAttorney Richard W. Rogers, Ill, (\"Rogers\") as substitute counsel. Dkt. No. 63. The\nmotion to substitute counsel indicated that potential remedies which may exist for\nGutierrez include filing a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nRecognizing\nthat federal law entitles death-row inmates to the appointment of more than one\nattorney, the Court ordered Gutierrez to request the assistance of an additional\nattorney by August 10, 2018. Petitioner now seeks to the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA as Rogers' co-counsel. Dkt. No. 66.\nSuch appointment would be conditioned\non the FCDO-EDPA receiving approval to pursue out-of-district representation from\n(1) the Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, and (2) Fifth Circuit Chief Judge Carl E. Stewart. Id. at 4.\n1/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 2 of 4\nDavis opposes the appointment of co-counsel.\nDkt. No. 69. Respondent\nprovides four reasons for objecting to FCDO-EDPA serving as co-counsel:\n(1)\nRespondent objects to any delay that would result from the appointment of FCDO\u00ad\nEDPA, id. at 2-3; (2) Respondent contends that no conflict of interest exists between\nGutierrez\nand\nRogers requiring the\nsubstitution\nof counsel,\nid.\nat\n3-4;\n(3)\nRespondent argues that appointed counsel does not have a statutory right to file a\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and thus additional attorneys for the preparation of\nthat lawsuit are not necessary, id. at 4-5; and (4) the interests of justice do not\nrequire the appointment of counsel to assist in a \u00a7 1983 case which is \"an extremely\nlimited proceeding,\" id. at 5.\nGutierrez filed a reply to Davis' opposition.\nDkt. No. 70.\nGutierrez replies\nthat any delay is not his fault, but that of Schmucker for failing to bring problems\nwith her representation before the Court in a timely manner. Id. at 1-2. Gutierrez\nargues that Davis relies on an incorrect standard when opposing the appointment of\nco-counsel. Id. at 2. Likewise, Gutierrez contends that Davis presents a constricted\nview of the responsibilities of co-counsel which will encompass more than assisting\nin a civil rights action. Id. at 3. Even under the standards propounded by Davis,\nhowever, Gutierrez argues that he has an entitlement to co-counsel under the law.\nId. at 1-4.\nII.\nLegal Standard\nFederal law entitles Gutierrez \"to the appointment of one or more attorneys .\n\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599a)(1); see also McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 (1994)\n(finding,\nunder\na\nformer\nstatute, that federal\nlaw\n\"grants\nindigent\ncapital\ndefendants a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel\").\nThe governing statute\ndoes not necessarily require the appointment of more than one attorney. After the\nappointment of one qualified attorney, \"the court, for good cause, may appoint\nanother attorney whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise\nenable him or her to properly represent the defendant, with due consideration to the\nseriousness of the possible penalty and to the unique and complex nature of the\nlitigation.\"\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599(d) (emphasis added).\nHowever, the federal court's\n2/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 3 of 4\nGuide to Judiciary Policy contemplates that \"[d]ue to the complex, demanding,\nand protracted nature of death penalty proceedings, judicial officers should consider\nappointing at least two attorneys.\" Vol. 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy\u00a7 620.10. 20b)\n(emphasis added).\nIII.\nAnalysis\nRespondent asks the court to apply the interests-of-justice standard when\ndeciding whether to appoint co-counsel in this action. Dkt. 69 at 2-5; see Christeson\nv. Roper,\nU.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 891, 894 (2015) (applying interests-of-justice\nstandard to motions to substitute counsel); Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 663 (2012)\n(same).\nUnder statutory law, however, Gutierrez only needs to show \"good cause\"\nfor the appointment of another attorney.\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).\nFederal judicial\npolicy presumes that the complex nature of capital representation itself present\ngood cause for representation by at least two attorneys.\nRespondent also objects that the court should not appoint counsel because it\nappears that Gutierrez will soon litigate a civil rights action. Respondent contends\nthe filing of that lawsuit should not require the services of more than one attorney.\nThe appointment of co-counsel, however, is not limited to that one task. Once a\ncourt appoints an attorney under\n\u00a7\n3599, that attorney \"shall represent the\ndefendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings ....\"\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599(e).\nCo-counsel will have a responsibility to represent Gutierrez\nthroughout \"all available post-conviction process, together with applications for\nstays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures,\" as well as\n\"competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency.\"\nId.\nWhile the filing of a civil rights action is foreseeable, so are other possible avenues\nof relief such as a motion for a stay of execution, state clemency, and successive\nhabeas proceedings.\nRespondent's narrow view of appointment does not fully\ncapture the possible work co-counsel may perform.\nReviewing the pleadings and the law, and in consideration of the possible\nremedies available to Gutierrez, the Court finds that Gutierrez has shown good\ncause for the appointment of co-counsel.\n3/4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-00022\nDocument 71\nFiled on 08/14/18 in TXSD\nPage 4 of 4\nIV.\nConclusion\nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Gutierrez's Motion to Appoint Co-Counsel.\nDkt.\nNo.\n66.\nFinding that the\nrequested\nco-counsel\nmeets\nthe\nstatutory\nqualifications, the Court CONDITIONALLY APPOINTS the Federal Community\nDefender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as co-counsel pursuant to\n18 U.S.C. $ 3599d).1 The contact information for co-counsel is as follows:\nShawn Nolan, Chief\nCapital Habeas Unit\nFederal Community Defender\nEastern District of Pennsylvania\n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545\nWest Philadelphia, PA, 19106\n(215) 928-0520\nShawn_Nolan@fd.org\nThis appointment is effective upon the Defender Services Office's and the\nFifth Circuit Chief Judge's administrative approval of the FCDO-EDPA's request to\nseek an out-of-district appointment.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with \nthe United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have \napplied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed. See Johnson v. \nGriffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). \nThe question presented is: \n \nDoes Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a \nspecific state official will redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by following a favorable \ndeclaratory judgment? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \niii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS IN LOWER FEDERAL COURTS \n \nSouthern District of Texas, Gutierrez v.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed \nhas standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed suffered an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s statute \nviolates due process, it is \u201csubstantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide \nby such a court order.\u201d \n \nIn this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was \nindistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article \nIII standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties\u2019 dispute and any legal \narguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would \nactually redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by complying with a federal court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment.

The order of the \ndistrict court granting the declaratory judgment (A17\u2013A42) is reported at 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 892 (S.D. Tex. 2021). \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe court of appeals issued its opinion vacating the declaratory judgment on \nFebruary 8, 2024. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc on May 29, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND STATUTES INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in \npertinent part: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law . . . . \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \n\n \n2 \n \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or \nother proper proceeding for redress . . . . \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA testing under this chapter \nonly if the convicted person establishes by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA testing . . . . \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in \npertinent part: \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing \nan initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant \nrelief based on the subsequent application unless that application \ncontains sufficient specific facts establishing that by clear and \nconvincing evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution \nno rational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \ntrial . . . . \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court has never found that a prisoner lacks Article III standing to bring \na constitutional challenge against state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. \nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 67\u201368 (2009); Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011); Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). In Reed, the only case to address the question \nexplicitly, this Court made clear that the standing requirements are not onerous in \nthis context:  \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nevidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied \naccess to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA testing. It is \u201csubstantially \nlikely\u201d that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nId. at 234 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nGutierrez, a condemned man, also sought and was denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and, like Reed, filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \nstatute violated due process. In Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth \nCircuit grafted onto Reed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the \nopposite result. Specifically, the majority scrutinized the state court record, including \nbriefing by the parties, and speculated that, in this case, state officials would not \npermit DNA testing even in the face of a federal court judgment because, in earlier \nproceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) commented that favorable \nDNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death penalty. Therefore, \n\n \n4 \n \nthe majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the redressability prong of Article \nIII standing. \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed dictates that Gutierrez has \nstanding: \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry and delving into what \nDistrict Attorney Goertz himself would do, the Court determined that a \ndeclaratory judgment invalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood that the state prosecutor \nwould grant access to the requested DNA testing. Because the standing \nanalysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, also facing execution, has \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nA16. \n \nGutierrez is indistinguishable from Reed in terms of standing. The standing \nanalysis this Court conducted in Reed could have and should have applied here. The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision to fashion a new, burdensome test has created a circuit split \nwith the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both of which applied Reed to cases with \nplaintiffs in situations virtually identical to those of Reed and Gutierrez. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to resolve the circuit split and to ensure fidelity to its \nprecedent. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and related offenses in the \nkilling of Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death in 1999. The prosecution\u2019s \ntheory at trial was that Gutierrez and two others planned to lure Harrison out of her \nmobile home where she kept large amounts of cash and then steal the cash from her \nempty dwelling. The evidence showed that two men entered the mobile home and \nthat Harrison was stabbed to death with two screwdrivers. Gutierrez\u2019s appellate, \n\n \n5 \n \nstate post-conviction, and federal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez v. \nStephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who maintains that he neither entered \nHarrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing \nunder Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) of items recovered \nfrom the crime scene, including a blood-stained shirt belonging to Harrison\u2019s nephew \nand housemate, nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her \nfingers, and various blood samples from within the mobile home. These items were \ncollected from the crime scene by detectives and continue to be preserved because \nthey contain biological material that can reveal who was in Harrison\u2019s home during \nthe crime. Yet this critical evidence has never been tested.  \nBecause of Texas\u2019s expansive law of parties, even those who do not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of capital \nmurder. Tex. Penal Code Sec. 7. But not all who are guilty under the law of parties \nare eligible for the death penalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to \nbe put to death for merely being a party to a murder.\u201d). Gutierrez was prosecuted and \nconvicted under Texas\u2019s law of parties. He has fought for over a decade to test the \nbiological evidence collected at the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be killed.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern DNA testing can provide \npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office v. \n\n \n6 \n \nOsborne, 557, U.S. at 62. Since the time of Gutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its \nDNA testing protocol to require mandatory testing of all items with biological \nmaterial in capital cases where the State pursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA testing of these items \nwould have already happened, and Gutierrez never would have been sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the biological material collected \nin his case was denied by the trial court and the CCA in 2011. A43\u2013A58. The CCA \nrelied heavily on the law of parties, holding that even if Gutierrez proved that he did \nnot participate in the assault on Harrison, there were no reasonable grounds for \ntesting under Chapter 64 because, as one of the parties, he was still guilty of capital \nmurder. A51\u2013A52, A55\u2013A58. The CCA further held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for \nnot seeking DNA testing at trial and that one of the pieces of evidence he sought to \ntest\u2014the hair around the victim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could not be \ntested. A53\u2013A56. Finally, it ruled that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow that a death-sentenced prisoner is innocent of the death penalty. A58. The court \nthen commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage as well as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled to \ntesting. Appellant would still have been death-eligible because the record facts satisfy \nthe Enmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d Id. (referencing Enmund v. Florida, \n458 U.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987)). \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed federal habeas counsel in \n2019 obtained access to files at the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \nCounsel filed a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors distinguished this motion \nfrom previous efforts: (1) Texas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter 64, \neliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) habeas counsel located the loose \nhair, previously thought lost, in a sealed envelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; (3) \nadvances in DNA testing made it possible to obtain usable DNA from degraded \nsamples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA from items with which a perpetrator has come into contact; \nand (4) counsel discovered significant new evidence casting doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role \nin the crime, including evidence that the lead detective had lied about the time of \ndeath, lied about the main alternative suspect passing a lie detector test (he actually \nfailed); and lied about whether an eyewitness identified Gutierrez (she identified \nanother man as the suspect, not Gutierrez). A72.   \nThe trial court initially granted the DNA motion, but after the State filed a \nresponse and proposed order denying the testing, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order. A59\u2013A61. The CCA affirmed the denial of relief. \nA62\u2013A81. Tracking its prior analysis, the court ruled that Gutierrez could not show \nthat he would have been acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been obtained \nbecause of the law of parties, and that testing is not available under Chapter 64 to \nshow innocence of the death penalty. A73\u2013A80. The court then quoted its prior \nopinion that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to evidence that might affect the \npunishment stage,\u201d Gutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible.\u201d A80.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOn September 26, 2019, Gutierrez filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 in the district \ncourt. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures, as well as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution protocol \nwhich, at the time, did not allow a spiritual advisor to be in the execution chamber \nwith the condemned. A18. Following a stay of execution and a remand from this Court \non the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), \nthe district court issued a partial declaratory judgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor on the \nDNA challenge. A17\u2013A42. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of Gutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded \nthat Chapter 64 violated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one significant respect. The \ndistrict court observed that Chapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA testing \nonly to establish innocence of a crime, not innocence of the death penalty. A38\u2013A39. \nAt the same time, however, Texas grants death-sentenced prisoners the substantive \nright to obtain relief by a successive post-conviction petition based on newly \ndiscovered or available evidence showing that the prisoner is innocent of the death \npenalty. A39 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(3)). The district \ncourt cited this Court\u2019s history of finding that \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \n\u2018meaningless ritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of by the courts.\u201d \nA40 (citing Douglas v. People of State of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). \nGranting the right to a successive habeas petition to show innocence of the death \npenalty while denying access to the evidence that could vindicate that right was found \n\n \n9 \n \nto be such an empty ritual. The district court thus held that the two statutory \nprovisions \u201care irreconcilable.\u201d A40. Accordingly, the district court held that Chapter \n64, as construed by the CCA, violated due process, A41, and granted declaratory \nrelief, A42.  \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on the declaratory judgment, \nGutierrez again filed a motion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking DNA \ntesting to establish his innocence of the death penalty. The trial court denied the \nmotion, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction. A82. On appeal, the State contended that \nthe new motion was barred by the CCA\u2019s previous opinions regarding Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. The CCA did not accept those arguments, overruled the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction, and remanded for de novo consideration of the DNA testing \nmotion to show innocence of the death penalty. A91. On remand, the trial court denied \nthe motion on procedural grounds and declined to address the merits. A92. Gutierrez \ntimely appealed to the CCA, and that appeal is currently pending before the CCA. \nNo. AP-77,108. \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court granted the State\u2019s motion for \npartial final judgment on the DNA claims. The State then appealed. On February 8, \n2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, \nholding that Gutierrez lacks standing. A2\u2013A16. The majority distinguished Reed \nbased on its mistaken belief that, there, the CCA had not held that Reed\u2019s request for \nDNA testing \u201cwould still fail\u201d even if Chapter 64 violated federal law. A13. Judge \n\n \n10 \n \nHigginson dissented, concluding that Gutierrez has standing because his case cannot \nbe distinguished from Reed. A16.  \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Gutierrez\u2019s Petition for Panel Rehearing and Petition \nfor Rehearing En Banc on May 29, 2024. A1. \nGutierrez has timely and diligently pursued the litigation in this case.  \nNevertheless, despite the ongoing nature of litigation in both state court and the Fifth \nCircuit, on April 5, 2024, the State filed a motion requesting an execution date be set. \nGutierrez opposed that motion and asked the court to wait for this litigation, \nincluding this Court\u2019s review, to be completed before setting a date. The trial court \nrejected Gutierrez\u2019s request and signed the execution warrant on April 8, 2024, \nordering that his execution be set for July 16, 2024. Texas v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-\n1391. Because of the State\u2019s actions in seeking an execution date while this matter \nwas still in litigation, this case comes before this Court under the time constraints of \nan impending execution, rather than in the ordinary course of litigation.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision fashions a rule that undercuts Reed and creates a \ncircuit split on a question of law settled by this Court. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th \n506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023). This split will \ncontinue to grow if not addressed and curtailed by this Court. The question of Article \nIII standing is a threshold matter in every federal case, and private parties frequently \nseek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are not directly \nobligated to comply with their terms. \n\n \n11 \n \nWhat is more, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is both wrong and pernicious. The \nFifth Circuit has ignored this Court\u2019s clear precedent and gone out of its way to create \nan impractical, burdensome standing test requiring federal courts to probe the \nparties\u2019 dispute and litigation history with a fine toothcomb in order to foretell the \nfuture, contingent actions of state officials. This novel requirement is unworkable and \ncontradicts the Court\u2019s recent analysis of redressability in Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., No. 23-235, 2024 WL 2964140 (U.S. June 13, 2024), and \nReed, 598 U.S. 230.  \nI. \nTHE DECISION BELOW CREATES A CIRCUIT SPLIT BY \nREOPENING A QUESTON THAT THIS COURT SOUGHT TO \nSETTLE IN REED. \nCertiorari review is crucial when courts of appeals disagree about an area of \nfederal law. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a); see also Reed, 598 U.S.at 234 (certiorari granted to \nresolve circuit split regarding \u201cwhen the statute of limitations begins to run for a \n\u00a7 1983 suit regarding a State\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures\u201d). The need to \nresolve the circuit split in this case is particularly important because this Court had \nalready settled the precise standing issue before the Fifth Circuit, yet the Fifth \nCircuit opinion conflicts with that holding and creates an awkward new rule for \nstanding, requiring a pre-jurisdictional mini-trial to forecast the conduct of state \nofficials in response to a not-yet-issued declaratory judgment. See Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).  \nThe Fifth Circuit panel majority\u2019s rewriting of this Court\u2019s clearly established \nlaw should be addressed before additional circuit courts of appeals are faced with \ncases brought by plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 actions seeking declaratory judgments, and cases \nlooking to apply Reed\u2019s standing analysis generally.  \n\n \n12 \n \nA. \nThe Eighth Circuit \nThe majority\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 \n(8th Cir. 2023). Johnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in \nthe context of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional because it violates due process. Johnson, like Reed and Gutierrez, is \non death row, and sued the prosecuting attorney in his Arkansas county pursuant to \na \u00a7 1983 action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the State\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting statute violated due process. \nThe Eighth Circuit held that Johnson had standing under circumstances that \nare all but identical to those here. After recognizing the defendant\u2019s argument that \nstanding was not specifically addressed in either Osborne or Skinner, the Eighth \nCircuit stated: \u201c[A]ny lingering doubt about a prisoner\u2019s standing to bring the distinct \nprocedural due process claim recognized by those two cases was dispelled by the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Reed v. Goertz.\u201d Johnson, 69 F.4th at 511. The \nEighth Circuit held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s injury is redressable because, as explained in \nReed, \u2018if a federal court concludes [Arkansas\u2019s] post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate\u2019 the Prosecuting \nAttorney\u2019s \u2018justification for denying DNA testing.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Reed, 598 U.S. at 234). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s majority\u2019s reasoning, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nfinding of standing was unaffected by the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s prior holding in \nJohnson\u2019s motion for DNA testing that Arkansas\u2019s statute allows DNA testing only if \nit will \u201csignificantly advance\u201d the prisoner\u2019s claim of innocence, and that \u201cnone of the \nevidence that might result from the proposed testing could advance Johnson\u2019s claim \n\n \n13 \n \nof actual innocence.\u201d Id. at 508 (quoting state court decision). The Eighth Circuit, like \nJudge Higginson, simply followed Reed and applied it to the legal posture of the case. \nB. \nThe Ninth Circuit \nThe ruling below also contravenes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of Reed. In \nRedd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), Redd filed a \u00a7 1983 action against \njudges in the state court system, alleging that California\u2019s system of appointing \ncounsel violated his due process rights. \u201c[T]he State Officers contended that Redd \nlacks standing because his injury is not redressable by a decision in its favor.\u201d Id. at \n884. The Ninth Circuit concluded: \u201cOnce a court issues a declaratory judgment, that \norder effectuates a change in the legal status between the parties such that \u2018the \npractical consequences of that change would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the plaintiff \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Reed, 598 U.S. at 234 (additional internal quotations omitted)).  \nThe Ninth Circuit did not stop there:   \nIn Reed, for example, a Texas prisoner filed a section 1983 action \nclaiming the state\u2019s postconviction DNA procedures violated procedural \ndue process. . . . The \u201conly relief\u201d sought was \u201ca declaration that the \n[state court\u2019s] interpretation and application of state law was \nunconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment \nagainst the state prosecutor would redress that state\u2019s denial of DNA \ntesting. The declaration sought \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing\u201d and make it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d \nthat the state prosecutor would abide by the court\u2019s decision. \n \nId. (quoting Reed, 598 at 234) (additional internal quotations omitted). The Ninth \nCircuit thus did not undertake an individualized standing analysis to predict whether \nthe state defendants would actually give Redd the relief he sought if he prevailed in \nfederal court. The court instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was \n\n \n14 \n \nsimilarly situated to Reed\u2014exactly as the Eighth Circuit did in Johnson and as Judge \nHigginson did in his dissent here. \nII. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION CONTRADICTS THIS COURT\u2019S \nDECISION IN REED. \nBoth Ruben Gutierrez and Rodney Reed sit on death row in Texas. Both men \npetitioned their respective Texas district courts for post-conviction DNA testing \npursuant to Chapter 64, and both men were denied testing. Both men appealed to the \nCCA, and the CCA affirmed in both cases. The CCA told both men that, even if they \ngot the DNA testing they wanted, they would still ultimately be unable to obtain the \nrelief they sought. See Reed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); \nA79. \nBoth men filed \u00a7 1983 lawsuits in federal district court seeking declaratory \njudgments that Texas\u2019s Chapter 64 violates their due process rights. Reed argued \nthat Chapter 64 violates his due process rights because the chain-of-custody \nrequirements were too demanding. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 violates his due \nprocess rights because he could not move for testing to show he was innocent of the \ndeath penalty, despite a clear right to file a subsequent habeas petition on that \nground under Texas Article 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3). Both men named the local District \nAttorneys as defendants. Both District Attorneys opposed DNA testing and continue \nto oppose DNA testing.  \nBoth men were found by the district courts to have Article III standing. \nGutierrez prevailed in district court and obtained a declaratory judgment in his favor. \nA42. The district court in Reed\u2019s case dismissed his \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 12(b)(6) \n\n \n15 \n \nfor failing to establish Chapter 64 violated due process. Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-\n0794-LY, 2019 WL 12073901, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). The losing parties in \nboth cases appealed to the Fifth Circuit.  \nHere, the men\u2019s paths diverged. The Fifth Circuit did not question that Reed \nhad standing to bring his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit but found the action untimely. Reed v. \nGoertz, 995 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2021). On certiorari review, this Court rejected Texas\u2019s \nargument that Reed lacked standing and instead ruled that a favorable federal \njudgment \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting\u201d and create a substantial likelihood of compliance by the State. Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234. This Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s timeliness ruling and remanded \nfor further proceedings. Id. at 237.  \nIn Gutierrez\u2019s case, however, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit grafted onto \nReed an additional layer of standing analysis that led to the opposite result. The \nmajority scoured the state court record, including briefing by the parties, and \nspeculated that, in this case, state officials would not permit DNA testing even in the \nface of a federal court judgment because, in earlier proceedings, the CCA commented \nthat favorable DNA test results would not prove Gutierrez innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not meet the \nredressability prong of Article III standing.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well beyond the analysis this Court \nestablished in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not \nmention examining the state court\u2019s decision for whether it might affect the \n\n \n16 \n \nprosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3. The majority justified its departure from \nReed based on the principle that \u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having \nbeen so decided.\u201d Id. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2019) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). The majority opined, in \nother words, that this Court did not parse the state court record in Reed because that \nrecord simply escaped this Court\u2019s attention.  \n\u201cThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly rooted in American \nconstitutional law.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at *6. To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered an injury in fact, (ii) the injury \nlikely was caused by the defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be redressed by \nthe requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 \n(1992). This Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he second and third standing \nrequirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often flip sides of the same coin. If \nthe defendant\u2019s actions cause an injury, enjoining that action or awarding damages \nfor the action will typically redress that injury.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL \n2964140, at *6 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThis Court applied that clear connection between causation and redressability \nin its analysis of Reed\u2019s standing in challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s post-\nconviction DNA statute. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, straightforwardly \nexplained: \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the \nrequested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, \n\n \n17 \n \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a \nfederal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the \nstate prosecutor\u2019s justification for denying testing. It is substantially \nlikely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.  \n \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234 (quotation omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe practical \nconsequences of that change [in law] would amount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. \n(quotation omitted). Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s analysis of Reed\u2019s standing was clear, \ndirect, and easy to apply.  \nThis Court has advised that when courts have unanswered questions about \nstanding, they should look to similarly situated defendants for guidance: \u201cThe \n\u2018absence of precise definitions\u2019 has not left courts entirely at sea in applying the law \nof standing. Like \u2018most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable \ndefinition from developing case law.\u2019\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 2024 WL 2964140, at \n*8 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). \u201cIn \u2018many cases the standing \nquestion can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u2013\n52). \nThe dissent below recognized that Gutierrez\u2019s case was in virtually the same \nposition as Reed. A16. The dissent\u2019s analysis was simple and followed this Court\u2019s \ndirective that, when it comes to standing, similarly situated litigants should be \ntreated the same. \n\n \n18 \n \nIn contrast, the panel majority did not look at the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s \ncomplaint and compare them to the allegations in Reed\u2019s complaint, despite both \nparties having filed 28(j) letters with the Fifth Circuit to address the impact of Reed \nhere. If it had, the majority would have seen that the allegation in Gutierrez\u2014that \nChapter 64 violates due process\u2014was identical to the allegation in Reed. Moreover, \nthe defendants in both cases were equivalent state officials, and the requested relief \nwas identical. The majority nonetheless failed to follow this Court\u2019s clear directive to \nanswer the standing question \u201cchiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular \ncomplaint to those made in prior standing cases.\u201d Allen, 468 U.S. at 751\u201352. The \nmajority instead dispensed with the principle that standing applies equally to \nsimilarly situated parties and replaced it with a burdensome requirement that will \nhereupon individualize a plaintiff\u2019s standing. Under the majority\u2019s approach, \nstanding will now depend on how particular state officials\u2014or any federal \ndefendants\u2014may act in the future following a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  \nWhat is especially egregious about the Fifth Circuit\u2019s attempt to distinguish \nReed, however, is that the court\u2019s premise that Reed\u2019s posture in the CCA was \ndifferent than Gutierrez\u2019s posture is glaringly wrong. The panel majority postulated \nthat, \u201c[i]f Reed is to be distinguished from this case, we need to determine if the Court \nof Criminal Appeals held, even if chain-of-custody limitations violated federal law, \nthat Reed\u2019s claim would fail.\u201d A13. The majority then concluded that the CCA had \nbeen silent on this question and distinguished Reed on the ground that \u201c[t]he Texas \n\n \n19 \n \ncourt made no holding in Reed comparable to its holding in Gutierrez.\u201d A13\u2013A14 n. 4. \nThe majority erred because its chosen distinction contradicts the events of Reed.  \nIn order to obtain DNA testing, Reed, like Gutierrez here, would still need to \nsatisfy all the requirements of Chapter 64, including that \u201cthe request for the \nproposed DNA testing is not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or \nadministration of justice.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(2)(B). The trial \ncourt found that Reed did not meet this requirement for seven distinct reasons. See \nReed v. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 777\u201378 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). On appeal, the CCA \naffirmed, \u201chold[ing] that Reed failed to establish that his request is not made to \nunreasonably delay the execution of his sentence or the administration of justice.\u201d Id. \nat 778. The CCA\u2019s analysis of why Reed cannot get relief because he cannot satisfy \n\u00a7 64.03(a)(2)(B) spans three pages\u2014far beyond the two sentences of dicta in the CCA\u2019s \nGutierrez opinions that the Fifth Circuit relied on here. The CCA thus squarely held \nthat Reed cannot obtain DNA testing for reasons that have nothing to do with the \nDNA statute\u2019s chain-of-custody limitations that Reed challenged in federal court. \nThis Court nonetheless held that Reed had standing because his complaints about \nChapter 64 were potentially redressable. The record in Reed thus refutes the \nmajority\u2019s attempt to distinguish it from this case.   \n \nThe Fifth Circuit may not disregard this Court\u2019s determinations and legal \nprecedents to strain for a result that it prefers. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-\nCruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a lower \ncourt in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it \n\n \n20 \n \nis essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court \ndecisions.\u201d); Winslow v. FERC, 587 F.3d 1133, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(\u201cVertical stare decisis\u2014both in letter and in spirit\u2014is a critical aspect of our \nhierarchical Judiciary headed by \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Const. art. III \n\u00a7 1)).  \nReversal of the Fifth Circuit is necessary to ensure adherence to this Court\u2019s \nconstitutional holdings, consistent application of a bedrock legal standard, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. See, e.g., James v. City of Boise, 577 U.S. 406, 307 (2016) \n(granting summary reversal and emphasizing that lower courts are \u201cbound by this \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Federal law\u201d); Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.S. 385, 395 (2016) (per \ncuriam) (noting that this Court \u201chas not shied away from deciding fact-intensive cases \nwhere, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law\u201d); Marmet \nHealth Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532 (2012) (per curiam) (granting \nsummary reversal where lower court\u2019s interpretation of federal law \u201cwas both \nincorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court\u201d). In \ncreating a novel requirement that conflicts with Reed, the Fifth Circuit majority has \nignored established Supreme Court precedent and created a circuit split where none \nshould exist. This Court should grant certiorari. \n \n \n\n \n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should grant the writ of certiorari \nand stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in that court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n \nDated:  June 25, 2024",

      "eig_reasoning": "This action seeks the brief in opposition, which is a critical document for understanding the respondent's (Texas's) legal arguments. My current understanding is primarily based on the petitioner's position and the lower court's ruling. To make an informed prediction, it is essential to analyze the counterarguments that the Justices will be considering. The brief in opposition will directly address the standing issue from the state's perspective, detailing why the Fifth Circuit's decision was correct and why the Supreme Court should not grant certiorari. This information is fundamental to the task, hence the very high Task EIG. The Design EIG is moderate because while this action represents a standard and crucial step in legal analysis (examining both sides of an argument), its success primarily reinforces a known, effective strategy rather than discovering a novel one. Nonetheless, confirming the high utility of this step is valuable for the agent's overall design.",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigat\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied.

Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn.

This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex.

June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133. He obtained a stay of his \nfederal habeas proceedings while he litigated his first request for postconviction DNA \ntesting and a subsequent state habeas application. Order, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019. See Mot. to Withdraw and for Appointment \nof Sub. Counsel 4, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018); \nComplaint, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2019). And \nhe repeatedly sought to delay the district court\u2019s resolution of his civil rights lawsuit. \nOrder, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 7, 2020) (order \nstaying proceedings pending TCCA\u2019s resolution of Gutierrez\u2019s second Chapter 64 \nappeal); Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex.

Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.
