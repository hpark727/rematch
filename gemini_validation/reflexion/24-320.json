    "legal_questions": [
      "When disabled combat veterans claim past-due compensation, should the military use the CRSC statute's rules to calculate how far back they can be paid, or should it use the Barring Act's six-year limit?"

      "Yes"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "Simon Soto, a Marine Corps veteran with a combat-related disability, was medically retired in 2006 with less than 20 years of service. Although he became eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in 2009 when he received his disability rating, he did not apply until 2016. The Navy used the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limitation period to calculate his retroactive payments, giving him payments dating back only to 2010 instead of to 2008 when Congress had expanded CRSC eligibility to veterans with less than 20 years of service. Soto filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated veterans who received only six years of back payments, arguing that the CRSC statute\u2019s own procedures should apply instead of the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limit.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to Soto\u2019s class, holding that the CRSC statute was more specific and therefore superseded the Barring Act. The court also applied the pro-veteran canon of statutory interpretation, resolving any doubt in favor of the veterans. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.",

The central legal question is whether the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute's own rules for calculating retroactive payments supersede the general six-year statute of limitations found in the Barring Act. This is a classic statutory interpretation case. To make an informed prediction, I need to understand the arguments of both parties, the reasoning of the lower court, and the relevant legal principles at play. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Examine the Petitioner's (Soto's) arguments:** I'll start by reviewing the petitioner's brief to understand why they argue the CRSC statute's specific provisions should override the general Barring Act. This will likely involve arguments about statutory structure, legislative intent, and the pro-veteran canon of interpretation.\n2.  **Examine the Respondent's (United States') arguments:** Next, I'll review the government's brief. They will argue for the application of the Barring Act, likely focusing on it as a clear, long-standing, and general rule for claims against the government that requires an explicit waiver, which they will argue the CRSC statute does not provide.\n3.  **Analyze the Federal Circuit's decision:** The Federal Circuit's opinion is crucial as it provides the legal reasoning the Supreme Court is reviewing. Understanding why the Federal Circuit reversed the district court will illuminate the core legal disagreements and the arguments the Supreme Court will need to grapple with.\n4.  **Consider Amicus Briefs:** I will look for amicus briefs, particularly from veterans' organizations, to see what policy arguments and additional legal perspectives are being presented to the Court.\n5.  **Synthesize and Predict:** After gathering this information, I will analyze the competing interpretations through the lens of the current Supreme Court's jurisprudential approaches, particularly its emphasis on textualism.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 32a\u2013\n37a. \nJURISDICTION  \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 12, 2024. Pet. App. 20a. The Federal Circuit \ndenied petitioner\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en \nbanc on June 20, 2024. Pet. App. 40a. The petition for \n\n3 \n \nwrit of certiorari was filed on September 18, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet. App. 42a\u201347a. The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum. Res. Command, CRSC Frequently Asked Ques-\ntions \nFAQs, \n\n9 \n \ncannot demonstrate are combat-related \u201cwill not be \nconsidered in determining eligibility for CRSC or the \namount of CRSC payable.\u201d JA 89 (Guidance, Appx. \n102). This process distinguishes CRSC from other ben-\nefits programs like CRDP, for which one need not af-\nfirmatively apply.  \nThe CRSC statute does not limit the number of \nmonths for which an applicant may obtain payment. It \ndoes not state that CRSC will be paid only prospec-\ntively, or that it will be paid for a limited number of \nmonths for which the applicant was eligible before his \nor her CRSC application was submitted. To the con-\ntrary, subsection (b) specifies the amount to be paid to \neligible applicants \u201cfor any month.\u201d  \nB. Corporal Soto\u2019s service and injury \nCorporal Simon A. Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones. Joint Publ\u2019n 4-06, Mortuary Affairs  xiii-xiv \n(2011), https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp4_06.pdf. Re-\ntrieval is a risky operation, as it frequently occurs \nwhile combat is ongoing or has just ended, when dan-\nger from mines, explosives, or enemy combatants \n \nhttps://www.hrc.army.mil/content/CRSC%20Fre-\nquently%20Asked%20Questions%20FAQs (last visited Mar. 1, \n2025). \n\n10 \n \nremains particularly high. Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal. JA 15 \u00b6 52; https://veter-\nanmedals.army.mil/home/us-army-medals-award-\nbadges-ribbon-and-attachments-information/us-army-\nservice-campaign-medals-and-foreign-awards-infor-\nmation; https://www.marines.mil/Combat-Awards/Ar-\nticle/1831663/navy-marine-corps-achievement-\nmedal/. Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet. App. 31a. On August 31, 2017, the District Court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings. Order Denying Def\u2019s. Mot. For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019. The number of affected vet-\nerans has certainly increased in the more than five years since \nthat information was collected.  \n\n15 \n \nprescribe procedures and criteria for individuals to ap-\nply for CRSC.\u201d Pet. App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n852 (1986) (declining to endorse the respondent\u2019s ar-\ngument \u201cout of fear of where some hypothetical \u2018slip-\npery slope\u2019 may deposit us.\u201d). Recognizing that the \nCRSC statute provides its own settlement mechanism \nwill result in no more than the continued submission \nof claims by combat-disabled veterans, and their re-\nceipt of well-deserved, full compensation. \n \n \n\n46 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Federal Circuit should be re-\nversed. The district court\u2019s order granting summary \njudgment to Corporal Soto and the class should be af-\nfirmed. \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F. STICHMAN \nTACY F.

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv.

On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum. Res. Command, CRSC Frequently Asked Ques-\ntions \nFAQs, \n\n9 \n \ncannot demonstrate are combat-related \u201cwill not be \nconsidered in determining eligibility for CRSC or the \namount of CRSC payable.\u201d JA 89 (Guidance, Appx. \n102). This process distinguishes CRSC from other ben-\nefits programs like CRDP, for which one need not af-\nfirmatively apply.  \nThe CRSC statute does not limit the number of \nmonths for which an applicant may obtain payment. It \ndoes not state that CRSC will be paid only prospec-\ntively, or that it will be paid for a limited number of \nmonths for which the applicant was eligible before his \nor her CRSC application was submitted. To the con-\ntrary, subsection (b) specifies the amount to be paid to \neligible applicants \u201cfor any month.\u201d  \nB. Corporal Soto\u2019s service and injury \nCorporal Simon A. Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones. Joint Publ\u2019n 4-06, Mortuary Affairs  xiii-xiv \n(2011), https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp4_06.pdf. Re-\ntrieval is a risky operation, as it frequently occurs \nwhile combat is ongoing or has just ended, when dan-\nger from mines, explosives, or enemy combatants \n \nhttps://www.hrc.army.mil/content/CRSC%20Fre-\nquently%20Asked%20Questions%20FAQs (last visited Mar. 1, \n2025). \n\n10 \n \nremains particularly high. Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal.

Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet. App. 31a. On August 31, 2017, the District Court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings. Order Denying Def\u2019s. Mot. For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019. The number of affected vet-\nerans has certainly increased in the more than five years since \nthat information was collected.  \n\n15 \n \nprescribe procedures and criteria for individuals to ap-\nply for CRSC.\u201d Pet. App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n852 (1986) (declining to endorse the respondent\u2019s ar-\ngument \u201cout of fear of where some hypothetical \u2018slip-\npery slope\u2019 may deposit us.\u201d). Recognizing that the \nCRSC statute provides its own settlement mechanism \nwill result in no more than the continued submission \nof claims by combat-disabled veterans, and their re-\nceipt of well-deserved, full compensation. \n \n \n\n46 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Federal Circuit should be re-\nversed. The district court\u2019s order granting summary \njudgment to Corporal Soto and the class should be af-\nfirmed. \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F. STICHMAN \nTACY F.

This is a foundational piece of evidence for the task, making the Task EIG extremely high. From a design perspective, this action reinforces a core principle of effective legal prediction: systematically gathering and analyzing the primary briefs from both parties. Successfully executing this step validates the methodical, balanced approach to information gathering, which is a crucial component of a robust prediction strategy. While it's a standard step, its consistent necessity provides valuable data on building a reliable workflow, yielding a moderate-to-high Design EIG.",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp.

There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv.

On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum. Res. Command, CRSC Frequently Asked Ques-\ntions \nFAQs, \n\n9 \n \ncannot demonstrate are combat-related \u201cwill not be \nconsidered in determining eligibility for CRSC or the \namount of CRSC payable.\u201d JA 89 (Guidance, Appx. \n102). This process distinguishes CRSC from other ben-\nefits programs like CRDP, for which one need not af-\nfirmatively apply.  \nThe CRSC statute does not limit the number of \nmonths for which an applicant may obtain payment. It \ndoes not state that CRSC will be paid only prospec-\ntively, or that it will be paid for a limited number of \nmonths for which the applicant was eligible before his \nor her CRSC application was submitted. To the con-\ntrary, subsection (b) specifies the amount to be paid to \neligible applicants \u201cfor any month.\u201d  \nB. Corporal Soto\u2019s service and injury \nCorporal Simon A. Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones. Joint Publ\u2019n 4-06, Mortuary Affairs  xiii-xiv \n(2011), https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp4_06.pdf. Re-\ntrieval is a risky operation, as it frequently occurs \nwhile combat is ongoing or has just ended, when dan-\nger from mines, explosives, or enemy combatants \n \nhttps://www.hrc.army.mil/content/CRSC%20Fre-\nquently%20Asked%20Questions%20FAQs (last visited Mar. 1, \n2025). \n\n10 \n \nremains particularly high. Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal.

Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet. App. 31a. On August 31, 2017, the District Court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings. Order Denying Def\u2019s. Mot. For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019. The number of affected vet-\nerans has certainly increased in the more than five years since \nthat information was collected.  \n\n15 \n \nprescribe procedures and criteria for individuals to ap-\nply for CRSC.\u201d Pet. App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n852 (1986) (declining to endorse the respondent\u2019s ar-\ngument \u201cout of fear of where some hypothetical \u2018slip-\npery slope\u2019 may deposit us.\u201d). Recognizing that the \nCRSC statute provides its own settlement mechanism \nwill result in no more than the continued submission \nof claims by combat-disabled veterans, and their re-\nceipt of well-deserved, full compensation. \n \n \n\n46 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Federal Circuit should be re-\nversed. The district court\u2019s order granting summary \njudgment to Corporal Soto and the class should be af-\nfirmed. \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F. STICHMAN \nTACY F.

From a design perspective, this action reinforces a fundamental and generalizable strategy: always analyze the primary briefs from both the petitioner and the respondent. While not a novel strategy, successfully executing this step is a key part of a robust prediction process, thus providing moderate Design EIG.",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n0: 20250303172155989_Soto20Petitioner20Brief20final.json (score: 0.356)\nNo. 24-320 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n___________ \nSIMON A.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a. The opinion of the \nSouthern District of Texas granting summary judg-\nment for petitioner is unreported, but is available at \n2021 WL 7287022, and reproduced at Pet. App. 32a\u2013\n37a. \nJURISDICTION  \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 12, 2024. Pet. App. 20a. The Federal Circuit \ndenied petitioner\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en \nbanc on June 20, 2024. Pet. App. 40a. The petition for \n\n3 \n \nwrit of certiorari was filed on September 18, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet. App. 42a\u201347a. The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum. Res. Command, CRSC Frequently Asked Ques-\ntions \nFAQs, \n\n9 \n \ncannot demonstrate are combat-related \u201cwill not be \nconsidered in determining eligibility for CRSC or the \namount of CRSC payable.\u201d JA 89 (Guidance, Appx. \n102). This process distinguishes CRSC from other ben-\nefits programs like CRDP, for which one need not af-\nfirmatively apply.  \nThe CRSC statute does not limit the number of \nmonths for which an applicant may obtain payment. It \ndoes not state that CRSC will be paid only prospec-\ntively, or that it will be paid for a limited number of \nmonths for which the applicant was eligible before his \nor her CRSC application was submitted. To the con-\ntrary, subsection (b) specifies the amount to be paid to \neligible applicants \u201cfor any month.\u201d  \nB. Corporal Soto\u2019s service and injury \nCorporal Simon A. Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones.

Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal.

Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet. App. 31a. On August 31, 2017, the District Court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings. Order Denying Def\u2019s. Mot. For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019. The number of affected vet-\nerans has certainly increased in the more than five years since \nthat information was collected.  \n\n15 \n \nprescribe procedures and criteria for individuals to ap-\nply for CRSC.\u201d Pet. App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014).

Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n852 (1986) (declining to endorse the respondent\u2019s ar-\ngument \u201cout of fear of where some hypothetical \u2018slip-\npery slope\u2019 may deposit us.\u201d). Recognizing that the \nCRSC statute provides its own settlement mechanism \nwill result in no more than the continued submission \nof claims by combat-disabled veterans, and their re-\nceipt of well-deserved, full compensation. \n \n \n\n46 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Federal Circuit should be re-\nversed. The district court\u2019s order granting summary \njudgment to Corporal Soto and the class should be af-\nfirmed. \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F. STICHMAN \nTACY F.

The action is premature, as the agent has just completed its search steps and has not yet performed any synthesis or reasoning in a THINK step. Observing this failure (jumping to a final response without analysis) provides a very minor insight into a design flaw \u2013 the need for a mandatory synthesis step before concluding. However, this is a basic flaw, so the Design EIG is very low, at 0.1. A much more informative action would be to use THINK to analyze the gathered information.",
